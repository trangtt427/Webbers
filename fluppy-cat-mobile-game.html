            About Fluppy Cat
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
            After spending a whole week experimenting with different mobile
            games, my boyfriend and I were inspired to create our own. It was an
            opportunity to work on something that combined our passions in code,
            design, and games.

            Fluppy Cat: A Game of Patience
          </p>

          <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
            We wanted to make a game that had a lot of replay value and was easy
            to get into. We were inspired by Flappy Bird, a side scroller where
            the player has to tap on the screen repeatedly to keep the sprite
            hovering as they advance through the stages. Our game was going to
            be a playful knock-off of that but based off a tribute to my late
            cat Pibby. After a brainstorming session, we decided that the
            premise would be about Pibby flying through dark caverns on a
            blankey to collect magical fishbone orbs.
          </p>

          <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop">
            The iOS App Requirements
          </p>

          <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
            Using Trello, we set up a punchlist of things we needed from each
            other. Since we both owned iPhones, we could only build for Apple so
            that we can fully test it at home. I did some research about iOS
            guidelines for their apps and learned for every asset, I would need
            to create 3 versions: 1x, 2x, and 3x.
          </p>

          <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
            The following assets were needed:
          </p>
          <ol class="spacebottom">
            <li>
              Sprite component: This was going to be Pibby on his blankey.
            </li>
            <li>
              Backdrop: Since Pibby is orange, it would be a good contrast to
              put him in a dark environment to make him stand out. We decided on
              a purple background.
            </li>
            <li>
              Obstacles: The challenge of this game is being to navigate between
              obstacles as Pibby flies across the screen. We settled on
              stalactites and stalagmites.
            </li>
            <li>
              Score: In order to increase the player's score, Pibby would have
              to collect glowing fishbone orbs for points.
            </li>
            <li>
              iOS components for app: We also needed an app icon optimized for
              the iOS homescreen, and a logo for the title screen.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

            Creating the Artwork
          </p>

          <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
            I made some whiteboard doodles of the various objects in Fluppy Cat,
            keeping in mind that everything needed to be simple and digestible
            on a small screen. The final assets were drawn in Illustrator and
            Photoshop.

            The game was built with xcode and we even implemented sound effects!
            When it was time to test the game however, there was this incredible
            lag during the gameplay. It turns out that the lag was caused by the
            spikes. We read up on it and learned that in the world of game
            design, triangles are actually modified rectangles and are difficult
            to generate. Another thing we realized that it was also difficult to
            see the sharp points of the the tapered columns, making the game
            extremely hard. It was back to the drawing board to come up with a
            new idea.

            Removing the Spikes to Improve Performance

          <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
            To optimize the game performance and make the obstacles visible, I
            changed the spikes into crystals. It made just as much sense as the
            stalactites because crystals also form in caves. With their color
            and shape, it brought a nice contrast against the purple background.
            Thanks to their rectangular shape, there was no more lag.

            Testing Again
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
            We further tested the game with our coworkers. While there were no
            longer any delays in generating the crystal pillars, people found
            the game to be difficult still. They claimed that Pibby was too big
            and had difficulty moving him between the narrow openings between
            crystals. We solved this by slowing down the rate at which the
            pillars were generated and making Pibby smaller.

            The Takeaway: Thoughts and Lessons
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
            This was the first iOS-specific app that I designed. It was a fun
            project that allowed me to learn more about the requirements when
            designing for the iPhone. It also encouraged me to work on more
            mobile apps. Something I learned was that as a designer, I get
            tunnel-vision with the things I create. It's not until you allow a
            fresh pair of eyes to review your products to see if there are some
            issues. In this case, having other people play Fluppy Cat helped me
            realize that the game was initially a bit too difficult.
