              Everyone has a different start and a different path on how they ended up with their design career. Here's a bit of background on how I got to mine.</p>

         <h1 class="timeline-h1">Artistic Beginnings</h1>
         <p>At 3 years old, I was already showing an affinity for the arts. I was drawing, painting, and building things. I even made it on television after winning a county-wide art contest when I was 11 years old.</p>

        <h1 class="timeline-h1">Biology</h1>
         
         <p dir=ltr>I loved the science part of the curriculum in school. I became interested in genetics, medicine, human disease and psychology. I enjoyed learning about what makes up our bodies chemically, what makes us behave the way we do, and how we interact with others. I graduated with a B.S. in Biology from UCSB.</p> <img src="images/microscope.svg" width="300px">

         <h1 class="timeline-h1">Visual Design</h1>
       
         <p>Even while pursuing Biology, I kept my creative chops fresh with art courses and designing digital collateral for school events. Throughout college and after, I took on various freelance projects. It was clear that I enjoyed designing more than anything, so I made the decision to focus fulltime on my first love: creating things.</p>

       <h1 class="timeline-h1">Web Design</h1>
        
         <p dir=ltr>I got into designing for web and learned more about the world of development. I was keeping up with the latest happenings in both design and web technologies, while creating UIs for desktop. During this time, I taught myself how to code HTML/CSS.</p>

        <h1 class="timeline-h1">UX/UI Design</h1>
         
         <p>I began taking a holistic approach to design, focusing on every step of the process. I kept users at the forefront of my brain while designing and made sure that I was backing up my decisions with qualitative and quantitative data. To fortify my foundation, I enrolled in a one year program at UCSD to receive my User Experience Design Certificate.</p>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      UX design is the culmination of my lifelong pursuit of science and creativity. When people think about design, the first thing that comes to mind are the pretty visuals. UX design is more of a science; it's built on research, data, and testing, which I've become familiar with throughout studying Biology. It's exciting to be able to pick apart problems and provide creative solutions to help people in the digital space.

       <div class="twentyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">
      After working in different styles and across different teams, I've learned that great design doesn't come from just one person's moment of discovery. My experience has taught me that constant collaboration and iteration, backed up with end user research and input are what really strengthens the design.

       <p class="project-paragraph">In order to create designs that are powerful and purposeful, you need to understand the environment you're building in, and the people you're building for. Ask yourself the five Ws (who, what, when, where, why?) before asking how.</p>
