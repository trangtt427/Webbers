    <h1 class="project-h1">Project Overview</h1>
      
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">I came across an assignment detailing a company's need for a website facelift. The company, Power Plug, builds modules for vehicles to deliver improvements over factory tuning such as more horsepower and better throttle response. Their current website has a lot of pages full of technical product info, but the website flow didn't make them as accessible.</p>
     
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <h1 class="project-h1">Methods</h1>
      
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph">It was clear that the Power Plug team didn't have solid ideas in mind besides the fact that they wanted to update the look but keep their company colors. What they knew, was that in its current form, the website wasn't intuitive to users. I embarked on a quick journey through their website to pick it apart and figure out what elements I can improve. </p>
     
        <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
        <ol>
            <li>I can't say I like the homepage. I felt that the bright red was incredibly repulsive and unpleasant for my eyes.</li>
            <li>The Plug and Play homepage takeover was nothing more than just a giant static image of the product but has no information about it. </li>
            <li>The navigation menu could be improved to show users all the products of each vehicle instead of them having to sift through each submenu to see what's available.</li>
            <li>It's impossible to tell if there's an item in the cart because there is no indication despite having the cart icon on the top navbar.</li>
            <li>Customers can only talk to experts on the contact page via live chat window which isn't helpful when they have questions on other parts of the website.</li>
      
        </ol>
      
        <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
        <p class="project-paragraph">
            In conclusion, there were several things that can be changed to improve user experience (and to simply make the website look better).

      <p class="project-paragraph">With a few solutions in mind, I drew out some whiteboard sketches. At this time, I didn't concern myself with the colors or typography— just the barebones layout and flow.</p>
      
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
      <img src="../images/power-plug-website-redesign/ppsketch1.jpg" class="project-image"><p class="caption">Instead of having that giant block of red, I thought that having a smaller block dedicated to the product spotlight would be beneficial. There would be some information, and users can click to learn more.</p>

      <img src="../images/power-plug-website-redesign/ppsketch3.jpg" class="project-image"><p class="caption">After using their website for the first time, I realized there was no confirmation or indication that a message was sent. I proposed an idea where some sort of modal will appear to let users know that Power Plug received their message.</p>

        The pages that are adequate include the "News" and "Dealers" pages. I focused on revamping the other elements that I mentioned.

        <ul>
            <li>The homepage now contains a timed carousel that will cycle between different highlights. Each highlight is accompanied by a brief description and a button to view more about it.</li>
            <li>If there's an item in the cart, a red dot will indicate that.</li>
            <li>The navigation has been expanded to a mega menu where all vehicles and models are shown under the products link.</li>
            <li>A live chat window is now on every page of the website and can be minimized when not in use.</li>
            <li>The contact page has been stripped down and cleansed of its clutter. Now, a confirmation prompt will appear when visitors submit a message.</li>
