              <b>Sympathizing at an Early Age</b>
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              While growing up, my mom often took me to Oakland Chinatown to do her grocery shopping because we didn't have a lot of local Asian markets. We lived about 30 miles away from Oakland, so naturally for a young child, it felt like a mini-roadtrip each time. Oakland Chinatown also felt a whole lot different from where we lived— it's a lively and noisy metropolis with many elderly Chinese and Vietnamese folks. There was also a handful of homeless people along the sidewalks, some of them asking for money from passersby and local businesses. I remember walking beside my mom and her pulling me away to stay clear of the homeless hanging around on the sidewalks. As a kid, I was very curious about them and how they ended up in their situations. Regardless, I was overcome with sadness thinking about how these people didn't have families or access to food and shelter.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph spacebottom">
              I was exposed to other people's misfortunes at such a young age. The interest of wanting to help others was nurtured in me as a result. I thought to myself, "when I grow up, I want to be able to help people". I started working towards that goal.

                <b>Bonding With the Assisted Living Residents</b>
              </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              After college, I moved back home and took on a job at an assisted
              living facility in Walnut Creek, the same place I worked at prior
              to attending UCSB. This time, I worked as a medication technician.
              My day to day included taking vitals of residents, managing and
              distributing their medications, charting on their health, and
              communicating with their families and healthcare providers. I
              wanted to work there because it served as a way to obtain patient
              care hours in order to apply to a Physician Assistant Program, and
              it gave me a chance to see my old residents again.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              While the work wasn't pretty and the pay was rather low, the
              exposure I got from the job was eye-opening and really reinforced
              the truth that I care a lot about others. I found myself engaging
              with my residents more than what was needed of my job because many
              of them didn't have families who visited regularly. During my med
              pass, I would spend extra time with them, whether it was listening
              to their stories and needs or just talking about something as
              fleeting such as the weather. Sure, I could have used the extra
              time to relax in the breakroom, but there was something incredibly
              valuable with being able to interact with the residents. As a
              byproduct of that, I was able to cater to each resident's needs in
              terms of the way I approach them to give them their medication or
              extra care.

                <b>Volunteering at the Clinic</b>
              </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              Around the time that I was working at the assisted living
              facility, I was also volunteering twice a month at a RotaCare
              clinic, a community clinic that provides free healthcare services to
              uninsured families and individuals with limited ability to pay for
              medical care. I documented patient history and took vitals, ran
              hemoglobin A1c tests, and prepared patients for the physician
              visit. Many of our patients were non-native English speakers, with
              more than 75% speaking primarily Spanish. Some patients had young
              children who spoke English and served as translators for
              their parents.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              One of the best things that came out of this was seeing how
              grateful our patients were at the end of the night. Many of them
              were new to the states with limited resources and access to
              information, while some immigrated only several years ago and were
              struggling to make ends meet. Sometimes it was difficult to get the truth out of some of our patients. I had to earn their trust by ensuring that I was there to listen and to help. I learned a lot about how to
              communicate with people from different backgrounds. It really hit
              home for me because my parents are immigrants. I imagined that
              their experience was similar to what these patients are going currently going through. When working with these patients, I would ask my fellow Spanish-speaking volunteers to ask the patients questions detailing their backgrounds and symptoms. I made
              sure to carefully understand their stories, emotions, and struggles in order
              to provide the best possible care.

                <b>Empathy, Empathy, Empathy</b>
              </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              I have since then departed from my journey in healthcare because I
              discovered my true passion lies in helping others in a way where I
              truly feel in my element: UX design. It's something I can enjoy being a part of for the rest of my life. It was right up my alley because it is an
              area that focuses on empathy, creativity, and doing the most for others.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              I always reflect back to the years prior to me being a UX
              designer, when I was working closely with folks who had limited access to
              certain resources. I've always compared it to working with users
              in my role as a designer. To craft solutions that are effective
              and truly user-centric, I have to put myself in their shoes to
              learn about their needs. A lot of what I'm doing now reminds me what I used to do a few years back. Working with the elderly and patients
              have prepared me for this, whether it was documenting their
              patient stories or assessing their health. I found the skills to help me succeed as an effective communicator because of these experiences.
            </p>
            <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                <b>The Lessons I've Learned</b>
              </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph extraspacebottom">
              To become a better designer, one doesn't necessarily need to read
              about the latest trends in UX design or attend expensive design conventions. We are
              designing for people, not screens. We should surround ourselves
              with people, especially those with different backgrounds. Once that happens, then we can truly understand
              the gravity of what other people's emotions and needs out of our products. We learn
              about what makes people tick, what delights them, and what they
              want to achieve in using a product. We learn to become patient and empathetic when surrounding ourselves with others. I was lucky enough to learn
              this through my early experiences working with my patients and
              residents.
