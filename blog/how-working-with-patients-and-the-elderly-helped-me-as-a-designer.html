              Sympathizing at an Early Age
              </h1>
            <p class="blog-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              While growing up, my mom often took me to Oakland Chinatown to do her grocery shopping because we didn't have many Asian markets in our hometown. We lived about 30 miles away from Oakland, so naturally for a young child, it felt like a mini-roadtrip each time. Oakland Chinatown also felt very different from where we lived— it was lively and bustling with many first-generation elderly Chinese and Vietnamese folks. There was also a handful of homeless people in that area. I remember walking beside my mom and her pulling me away to stay clear of the homeless hanging around on the sidewalks. As a kid, I was very curious as to how they ended up in their situations. After dwelling on it, I was overcome with a heavy heart thinking about how these people didn't have families or access to food or shelter.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph spacebottom">
              I was exposed to some pretty dismal situations involving other people's misfortunes at such a young age. As a result, the passion of wanting to aid others nurtured within me. I thought to myself, "when I grow up, I want to be able to help people". I started working towards that goal in the most literal sense possible— by pursuing a profession in healthcare.

                Bonding With the Assisted Living Residents
            </h1>
            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              After college, I moved back home and took on a job at an assisted living facility in Walnut Creek, the same place I worked at prior to attending UCSB. This time, I worked as a medication technician. I needed the patient care hours in order to apply to a Physician Assistant Program. My day to day included taking vitals of residents, managing and distributing their medications, charting on their health, and communicating with their families and healthcare providers.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              While the work wasn't pretty and the pay was rather low, the exposure I got from the job was eye-opening and really reinforced the truth that I care a lot about others. I found myself interacting with the residents more than what was needed of my job because many of them didn't have families who visited regularly. During my med pass, I would spend extra time with them, whether it was listening to their stories and needs, or just talking about something as fleeting such as the weather. Sure, I could have used the extra time to relax in the breakroom, but there was something incredibly valuable with being able to engage with the residents on a personal level. Consequentially, I was able to cater to each resident's specific quirks in terms of the way I approach them to give them their medication or extra care.

                Volunteering at a Community Clinic
            </h1>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              Around the same time I was at the assisted living facility, I was also volunteering as a triage EMT twice a month at a RotaCare clinic, a community clinic that provides free healthcare services to uninsured families and individuals with limited ability to pay for medical care. I documented patient history and took vitals, ran hemoglobin A1c tests, and prepared patients for physician visits. Many of our patients were non-English speakers, with more than 75% speaking only Spanish. Some patients had young children who spoke enough English to translate for us.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              One of the most wholesome things that came out of this was seeing how grateful our patients were at the end of the night. Many of them were new to the states with limited resources and access to information, while some immigrated several years ago and were struggling to make ends meet. Sometimes it was difficult to get information from the patients because they thought we would report them to the State, fearing deportation. I had to earn their trust by ensuring them that wasn't the case, and that I was there to help. I learned a lot about communicating with people from completely different backgrounds. It really hit home for me because my parents are immigrants as well. I imagined that their experience was similar to what these patients were going through. With the help of volunteer translators, I made an earnest effort to carefully understand their stories, emotions, and struggles in order to provide the best possible care.

                Empathy, Empathy, Empathy
            </h1>
            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              I have since then departed from my journey in healthcare because I discovered my true passion lies in helping others in a way where I feel in my element: UX design. It's right up my alley because it is an area that focuses on empathy, creativity, and doing the most for others.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              I always reflect back to the humbling years before becoming a UX designer. To me, working with patients is similar to working with users. To craft solutions that are effective and truly user-centric, I have to put myself in their shoes to understand the problem space. Working with those demographics prepared me for this, whether it was interviewing patients for their medical history or figuring out the best way to get a resident to check their weight every day. It cultivated in me the skills to help me succeed as an effective communicator. In those times, I came to terms that some situations will get difficult and that things won't be in my control especially when dealing with frustrated people. The best thing to do is to empathize with them, acknowledge their struggles, and recognize what we have control of in order to come up with solutions.

                The Lessons I've Learned
            </h1>
            <p class="project-paragraph extraspacebottom">
              To become a better designer, one doesn't necessarily need to attend expensive design conventions or read about all the latest patterns in UX design. We are designing for people, not screens. We should surround ourselves with others to learn about them and about ourselves in the process. Once that happens, then we can truly engage with users and look at their situations as a whole to provide better experiences. We learn about what makes people tick, what delights them, and what they want to achieve in using a product. We learn to become accommodating and sensitive when we set out on a mission to help others. Sometimes, as designers, we find ourselves projecting onto our users. It's not until others challenge us and provide their perspective so we can fully understand why our proposals might not work for their specific situation. I was lucky enough to learn this through my early opportunities working within that community.
