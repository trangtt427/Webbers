            People often say that internal products rarely get the attention, love, or flair that their customer-facing counterparts would. The UX of these tools won't directly affect customers. It doesn't drive company revenue. But while some of this is true, thoughtfully designed internal products can do wonders for a company. If users are positioned for success with internal tools, this trickles down to efficient processes. That leads to more time and resources dedicated to customers. The final results? An excellent customer experience, a reputable company brand, and increased revenue.
          <p class="pre-paragraph">
            What Are Internal Products?
          </p>

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Internal products are proprietary tools built by a company for their internal teams. They exist to streamline the workflows specific to that company's operations, leading to increased productivity and efficiencies. 
          </p>

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            I've witnessed internal products being built with very little resources and planning so that they can be shipped as fast as possible to bring immediate value. But what started off as "low hanging fruits" become an aggregation of features that exist without consideration of the product as a whole. Creating these type of tools have repercussions down the line.
          </p>
          <ul><li>Features get implemented and the product becomes so niche that people need a lot of hand-holding and clear documentation to understand how everything works.</li>
            <li>If a product gets built without proper definition, this might lead to a half-baked product that doesn't address the top user needs. What you end up with are unhappy users who request more which leads to additional engineering overhead.</li>
            <li>Adding subsequent things without thinking about how it sits with the other parts of the product will result in a clunky and draining experience for users.</li>
            <li>Internal teams want to feel valued and heard, and if they're not empowered with performant tools, it makes them feel like their work is not impactful.</li></ul>

          <p class="pre-paragraph">
           Internal products are like any other product&#8212;designed with the users in mind to help them reach a certain goal.
          </p>

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Proper internal tools are built in the same fashion as external products. They start with problem definition, pushed through the gamut of design critiques, get scoped by engineering, and are tested after launch. In order for any product to be useful, whether internal or customer-facing, it has to consider its users as the Northstar. In this case, the users work at the same company as you, albeit busy with their actual job duties. Successful and awesome products are crafted with a spotlight on their users in order to achieve their intended outcomes. What's their workflow like? What are their pain points and current tricks? Are there any improvements they'd want to see?
          </p>
       
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            These users need to get a good picture of their business and operations, so the product interfaces are tailored to be data-heavy. The tools tend to be pretty complex and technical, but they are optimized to help users move along their workflow with as little friction as possible. Having an internal product architected for its users reduce manual effort and room for error. 
          </p>

          <p class="pre-paragraph">
            Discoveries made by internal tool research can shine light on company-wide challenges.
             </p>
             <p class="project-paragraph">
             The team leading the front on internal tools can help string together the various functions of the company to see things from a holistic perspective. This uncovers issues and challenges across the business that people overlooked because of silos. The research and findings can lead to other opportunities that the company might want to pursue, for sake of customer satisfication, compliance, or profit. It's important to have people or teams who can champion system-level thinking to bring the bigger picture into view. Building internal tools enable that.
            </p>
          <p class="pre-paragraph">
          Making a Case for Impact
           </p>
         

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            We hone in on an opportunity for tooling and predict that solving the challenge would bring benefit to the company. But how do we estimate its effectiveness? Internal tools rely more on quantitative metrics over qualitative metrics to prove their worth. Product teams and internal advocates must rally behind data. Measuring time is a good example of showcasing value. Track how much time users are spending on certain tasks and estimate how much time you can cut down with improved solutions. Translate that into hours and headcount. Nothing makes a stronger argument than the combination of UX that users will love and dollar-sign impact on business.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Let's say that the goal of improving an internal tool isn't to save on headcount. A tool is needed because users are currently using a wacky workaround that might put them at compliance risk. Functionalities designed to help users get their tasks done securely so that their company won't get audited or sued is also a pretty good argument for prioritizing good tooling.
          </p>
      
        
           <p class="pre-paragraph">
            An emphasis on great internal products sends a clear company message that customer experience is important. 
           </p>
    
          <p class="project-paragraph">
           These tools may be incredibly technical and not public, but in the end, we should understand that a human is using them to help get their job done. We should care about these humans as if they're our own customers, because they are the life force of a company. Their success reflects company-wide support and empathy for customers.
