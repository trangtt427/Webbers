            People often think that internal products rarely get the attention, love, or flair that their customer-facing counterparts would get. The UX of these tools don't directly affect customers. It doesn't drive company revenue. In reality, internal tools are designed to position internal teams for success. This means efficient processes, which trickle down to more time and resources dedicated to customers. The final results are an excellent customer experience, a reputable company brand, and impact on margins.
          <p class="pre-paragraph">
            What Are Internal Products?
          </p>

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Internal products are proprietary tools built by a company for their internal teams. They exist to streamline the workflows specific to that company's operations, maximizing productivity and efficiencies. 
          </p>

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            I've witnessed internal products being built with very little resources and planning so that they can be shipped as fast as possible to bring immediate value. But what started off as "low hanging fruits" become an aggregation of poorly-vetted features that exist without consideration of the product as a whole. Creating these type of tools have repercussions down the line.
          </p>
          <ul><li>Features get implemented and the product becomes so niche that users end up needing a lot of hand-holding and clear documentation to understand how everything works.</li>
            <li>Adding in new features without thinking about how it sits with the other parts of the product will result in a clunky and draining experience for users.</li>
            <li>If a product gets built without proper definition, this might lead to a half-baked product that doesn't address the top user needs. You're left with unhappy users who request more which leads to additional engineering overhead.</li>
            
            <li>Internal teams want to feel valued and heard, and if they're not empowered with performant tools, it makes them feel like their work is not impactful.</li></ul>

          <p class="pre-paragraph">
           Internal products are like any other product&#8212;designed with the users in mind to help them reach a certain goal.
          </p>

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            They are built in the same fashion as external products. They start with problem definition, are put through the ringer of design critiques, get scoped by engineering, and are tested after launch. In order for any product to be useful, whether internal or customer-facing, it has to consider its users as the Northstar. In this case, the users might even work in the same building. Successful and awesome products are crafted with a spotlight on users and their workflows. What are they trying to achieve? What are their pain points and current tricks? Are there any improvements they'd want to see? It's important to get to the root of what users actually need, and not what <i>they say they need.</i>
          </p>
       
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Internal teams rely on visibility of their business processes and operations to go about their tasks, so they need products that communicate a lot of information. The tools tend to be pretty data-intensive, complex, and technical, but they help users move along their workflow with as little friction as possible. Internal tools shouldn't have to make users think twice about the things they have to do. These products exist to reduce manual effort and room for error.
          </p>

          <p class="pre-paragraph">
            Discoveries made by internal tool research can shine light on company-wide challenges.
             </p>
             <p class="project-paragraph">
             Discoveries prompted by research around internal tools can help string together the various functions of the company to see things from a holistic perspective. This uncovers issues and challenges across the business that people tend to overlook because of working in silos. The research and findings can lead to other opportunities that the company might want to pursue, for sake of customer satisfication, compliance, or better margins. It's important to have people or teams who can champion system-level thinking to bring the bigger picture into view. Building internal tools enable that.
            </p>
          <p class="pre-paragraph">
          Making a Case for Impact
           </p>
         

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            We hone in on an opportunity for tooling and predict that solving the challenge would bring major benefit to the company. But how do we estimate its effectiveness? In my experience, internal product teams have better success relying more on quantitative over qualitative metrics to prove the worth of their projects. Product teams and internal advocates must rally behind data. 
          </p>
          <ol><li>Break down the specific areas of hte workflow and measure the time users are spending in each step.</li>
          <li>Make an estimate of how much time a solution can save, through dry runs of a solution.</li>
        <li>Translate that int hours and headcount.</li></ol>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            The combination of an intuitive, useful, and delightful product for users, and a dollar-sign impact on business speaks to the power of a good internal tool. But what if the need for better tooling isn't to save on headcount? Another case for it is because users are currently using a wacky workaround that puts them at compliance risk. Functionalities designed to help users get their tasks done securely so that their company won't get audited or sued is also a pretty solid argument for prioritizing good tooling.
          </p>
      
        
           <p class="pre-paragraph">
            An emphasis on great internal products sends a clear company message that customer experience is important. 
           </p>
    
          <p class="project-paragraph">
           Customers may never see these tools, but in the end, a human is using them to keep their company thriving. We should care about them as if they are <i>our customers.</i> They are essentially the life force of the company's operations. A company that positions their teams for success with the best in class internal products and internal product development processes, reflect their vigilance in providing the best customer experience.
