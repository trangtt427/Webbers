                A Year of Cleansing
              </h1>
            <p class="blog-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              The end of the year usually means a time of introspection for many people. Following a rather turbulent 2018 for me, this year was a total blessing in comparison. I landed a new job at a data analytics start-up, moved to the South Bay, got to travel to some places on the bucketlist, and Marie Kondo'd the heck out of my apartment. Five years ago, I never would have thought to make it this far. This year was about focusing on career development and learning about my own needs as an individual.

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacebottom">
              Today is the last day of 2019 and also the end of a formative decade for me. After spending the last few months of the year reflecting on my life, I came up with some simple but impactful goals for 2020 that I want to share.
            </p>

            <h1 class="major-section spacebottom spacetop">
                Goals For 2020
            </h1>
            <p class="blog-pre-paragraph">1. Never Stop Learning as a Designer</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              While I try not to let my work consume my life, my natural curiosity has kept me immersed in the latest trends, patterns, and news in design. But in order to remain competitive and focused in this fast-growing industry, I will need to keep my mind open and skills sharp. This journey can manifest in the form of going to more design meetups and talks, starting a side project, learning a new prototyping tool, or even doing a case study of an existing digital product. In addition to doing any of these, it's also great to explore outside the context of digital products. It's always fun to ask questions about the designs of random every day things like restaurant menus or government websites. Keeping relevant and asking questions are essential to being a designer if you want to stay committed to people.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-pre-paragraph spacetop">2. Try My Hand at Writing, Even If I'm Terrible at It</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              I've always admired great writers and people who are eloquent with words. Good writing can turn mundane topics into the most interesting pieces, even if it's about the history of cockroaches (no offense to entomologists!). I'm not a prolific writer myself, but it's something I want to start doing because there are so many ideas and thoughts floating around in my head that eventually pass. This doesn't mean that these thoughts aren't meaningful&mdash; there's a lot of good in store for people when they're able to communicate through writing. Being able to use the concise words to portray my thoughts exactly is something I strive for, whether it's me talking about why the Weeknd's artistic direction is top-tier or explaining to others what a catloaf is. I would mainly write to improve the way I collaborate and articulate with others, but as an added bonus, maybe my writing can intrigue, inspire, or entertain others.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-pre-paragraph spacetop">3. Create More Artwork</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              Before my entry into the world of designing digital products, my main creative outlet was drawing. It's something that has always provided me with a sense of purpose and peace of mind. Unfortunately, I haven't drawn much in the past year. I rarely get the chance to draw anymore, especially because my work doesn't require any artistic skills other than drawing boxes and simple mockups. While I love designing for others, drawing is a way for me to truly be creative and expressive. There's this mentality that is common amongst artists where we fear that our output isn't "good enough" as we compare ourselves to others. Having worked on a digital painting not too long ago reminded me of how easily I can sink hours into my craft. In 2020, I am striving to rid myself of that self-imposed obstacle and putting aside time so that I can create artwork for fun and without bounds.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-pre-paragraph spacetop">4. Be Adventurous With Cooking at Home</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              Are you really human if you don't have a New Year's resolution relating to weight loss/gain? I think many people can relate to this. It's easy to indulge in delicious and pricey dinners at restaurants, especially when you've spent over an hour in traffic on the way home from work and realized that you didn't put the meat out this morning to defrost. This has led me to not being able to keep track of my food intake each time I eat out, and has also contributed to my unnecessarily large credit card bills. Lately, I've been watching vlogs of ethnic cuisine from around the world and Youtube videos that are curated to show me how to cook those very dishes. I'm going to make an earnest effort to cook at home so that way I can save money and know where my ingredients comes from. I want to change my attitude about cooking&mdash; I want to see it as more of an opportunity to be resourceful and creative rather than it being a chore. My goal is to cook balanced meals so that I have enough for both lunch and dinner for most of the week. Wish me luck with this one!

            <p class="blog-pre-paragraph spacetop">5. "Is This Essential?"</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              Growing up as a child of immigrants from a war-torn country, I didn't have much in way of toys or luxuries. Even to this day, my mom insists on keeping useless items thinking they'll be used in the future&mdash; a mentality birthed from her hardships of the past. As a result of that, I grew up very attached to my belongings because everything felt sentimental. Nowadays as an adult with her own space, I've become much more aware of how quickly one's living space can get cluttered. Yes, I'm guilty of buying lots of shoes and other non-essential items but for 2020, I am going to make better decisions when it comes to sustainability going about my day-to-day. This means buying things that I only need, not forgetting to bring my own tote for groceries, buying bio-degradable household items, and bringing a personal mug to coffee shops. While buying only the essentials is a way to keep my apartment tidy, it also creates a sense of tranquility in my mind knowing that I don't need to clutter my life with materialistic things. I've learned that I don't need much to make me happy.

            <h1 class="major-section spacetop">
                A Year of Self-improvement
            </h1>
         
            <p class="blog-paragraph spacetop extraspacebottom">
              No world-changing goals here, just simple and highly achievable ones. As I get older, I start to see things in my life with more clarity. I know what it takes to make me happy. The tail end of 2019 was an eye-opening time, and 2020 is going to *hopefully* be an extension of that, where I can continue working on a better "me". I'm looking forward to making the best out of the next year while keeping these goals in mind.
