                A Year of Cleansing
              </h1>
            <p class="blog-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              It's the end of the year which means it's a time of introspection for many people. Following a rather turbulent 2018 for me, this year was a total blessing in comparison. I landed a new job at a data analytics start-up, moved to the South Bay, traveled to a few new places, and Marie Kondo'd the heck out of my apartment. Five years ago, I never thought I'd end up where I am today. I found myself focusing more on my career development and learned a lot about my own needs and habits within my personal life. For me, 2019 felt like a year of cleansing and starting anew.
            </p>
            <p class="blog-paragraph spacebottom">
              Today is the last day of 2019 and also the end of a formative decade for me. After spending the last few months of the year reflecting on my life, I came up with some simple but impactful goals that I want to focus on for 2020. I've already started the trajectory of heading towards these goals, but writing them down somewhere and sharing with others will definitely keep them sticky for me.
            </p>

            <h1 class="major-section spacebottom spacetop">
                Goals For 2020
            </h1>
            <p class="blog-pre-paragraph spacebottom">1. Never stop learning as a UX designer</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacebottom">
              While I try not to let my work consume my life, my natural curiosity has kept me immersed in the latest trends, patterns, and news in product design. As a designer with less than five years of UX design experience, I'm motivated to learn so that I can create usable and useful products that are truly suited for users. This goal can manifest in the form of going to more design meetups and talks, starting a side project, learning a new prototyping tool, or even doing a case study of an existing digital product. In addition to doing any of these, I can also assess designs of every day things to see what problems they solve for people. Asking 'why' is always a great first step for UX design process after all.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-pre-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">2. Try my hand at writing</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacebottom">
              One of my lesser known interests include writing. It's something I want to start doing because there are so many ideas and thoughts floating about in my head that I eventually forget about. This doesn't mean that these thoughts aren't meaningful because I believe there's a lot of good in store for people when they're able to express them via writing. While it's a way to immortalize my ideas, I would mainly write to improve the way I communicate and articulate to others. Plus, there is a handful of miscellaneous things that interest me, and I think they're worth writing about. I've already taken baby steps like writing this post in my blog section. Although it's meant to better myself as a creative, I hope that there's value in my writing for other people so that they can be inspired, intrigued, or entertained.
            </p>

            <p class="blog-pre-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">3. Create more artwork</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacebottom">
              Before my entry into the world of designing products, my main creative outlet was drawing. It's something that has always provided a peace of mind for me, and I've been lucky enough to have nurtured the skill while growing up. As a child, I used to draw on napkins and printer paper at home. Eventually, my drawings found their way onto my homework and classwork. While I love designing for others, drawing is a way for me to truly be creative and expressive. There's this mentality that is common amongst artists where we fear that our output isn't "good enough" as we compare ourselves to fellow artists. In 2020, I am striving to rid myself of that self-imposed obstacle and putting aside time so that I can freely create artwork without any feelings of inadequacy.

            <p class="blog-pre-paragraph spacebottom spacetop">4. Be adventurous with cooking at home</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacebottom">
              This is important for me because out of all of my goals, this one really affects my physical health. I think many people can relate to this. It's easy to indulge in delicious and pricey dinners at restaurants, especially when you've spent over an hour in traffic on the way home from work and are just too tired to cook. This has led me to not being able to keep track of my food intake each time I eat out, and has also contributed to my unnecessarily large credit card bills. Lately, I've been watching vlogs of ethnic cuisine from around the world and Youtube videos that are curated to show me how to cook those very dishes. I'm going to make an earnest effort to cook at home so that way I can save money and know where my ingredients comes from. I want to change my attitude about cooking— I want to see it as more of an opportunity to be resourceful and creative rather than it being a chore. Cooking is also a great activity to do with my partner. My goal is to cook balanced meals so that I have enough for both lunch and dinner for the week.

            <p class="blog-pre-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">5. Question the sustainability of my purchases</p>

            <p class="blog-paragraph spacebottom">
              For 2020, I am going to make better decisions when it comes to sustainability going about my day-to-day. This means not forgetting to bring my own tote for groceries, buying bio-degradable household items, and bringing a personal mug to coffee shops. While buying only the essentials is a way to keep my apartment tidy, it also creates a sense of tranquility in my mind knowing that I don't need to clutter my life with materialistic things. I've really learned that I don't need much to make me happy.
            </p>
            <h1 class="major-section spacebottom spacetop">
                A year of self-improvement
            </h1>
         
            <p class="blog-paragraph extraspacebottom">
              I would say that my goals are pretty standard and more importantly, achievable in many ways. Sure, they're not about changing the world nor are they huge lifestyle changes, but that doesn't make them any less important to me. As I get older, I start to see things in my life with more clarity— I'm able to easily identify what I should improve on and pinpoint what makes me happy. Those two things are the most important to me. The tail end of 2019 was an eye-opening time, and 2020 is going to be an extension of that, where I continue working on improving myself in my personal life and career. I'm looking forward to making the best out of the next year while keeping these goals in mind.
