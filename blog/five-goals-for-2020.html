                A Year of Cleansing
              </h1>
            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              The end of the year usually means a time of introspection for many. Following a rather turbulent 2018 for me, this year felt like a blessing. I landed a new job at a data analytics start-up, moved to the South Bay, got to travel to some places on the bucketlist, and Marie Kondo'd the heck out of my apartment. This year was about focusing on career development and learning more about myself in the process.
            </p>
            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              Today is the last day of 2019 and also the end of a formative decade for me. After spending the last few months of the year reflecting on my life, I came up with some lifestyle changes that I want to make in 2020.

            <h1 class="major-section spacebottom spacetop">
                Goals For 2020
            </h1>
            <p class="pre-paragraph">1. Never Stop Learning as a Designer</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
             The world of software is constantly evolving, and at a fast pace too. It's important for designers to stay on top of technologies and emerging trends so we can put out solutions that modern users can appreciate. For me, this can manifest in the form of going to more design meetups and talks, starting a side project, or trying out some popular apps and assessing its usefulness and design. Staying stagnant is the nemesis of creativity. I'm a firm believer that great designers are never complacent— they're constantly challenging themselves and continuously adding value into the world.
            </p>

            <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop">2. Try My Hand at Writing, Even If I'm Terrible at It</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
Good writing does a lot for people, and I'm saying this as someone who's been moved by eloquently written pieces that are powerful, influential, mind-opening, and are breeding grounds for great discussions. Good writing can turn even the most mundane topics into engaging narratives. I'm not a prolific writer, but it's something I want to improve because I want to inspire others through my experiences. Not only would it help me collaborate and articulate with others in a professional setting, but maybe as an added bonus, my writing can intrigue or entertain others.
            </p>

            <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop">3. Spend More Time With My First Love: Drawing</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              Before my entry into the world of designing digital products, my main creative outlet was drawing. It's something that has always provided me with a sense of purpose and peace of mind. Unfortunately, I rarely get the chance to use my Wacom tablet anymore, especially because my work doesn't require any artistic skills other than drawing boxes and simple mockups. From time to time, I fall victim to the mentality that my output isn't "good enough" as I compare myself to fellow artists. But having worked on a digital painting not too long ago reminded me of how easily I can sink hours into my craft. In 2020, I am striving to rid myself of that self-imposed mental block and putting aside time to create artwork for fun and without bounds.
            </p>

            <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop">4. Be Adventurous With Cooking at Home</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
             It's easy to indulge in delicious and pricey dinners at restaurants, especially when you've spent over an hour in traffic on the way home from work and realized that you didn't put the meat out this morning to defrost. This is the culprit behind my unnecessarily large credit card bills and poor diet. Lately, I've been watching vlogs of delicious foods and Youtube videos that are curated to show me how to cook those very dishes. I'm going to make an earnest effort to cook at home so that way I can save money and know where my ingredients comes from. I want to change my attitude about cooking&mdash; I want to see it as more of an opportunity to be resourceful and creative rather than it being a chore. My goal is to cook balanced meals so that I have enough for both lunch and dinner for most of the week. Wish me luck with this one!
            </p>
            <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop">5. "Is This Essential?"</p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              Growing up as a child of immigrants from a war-torn country, I didn't have much in way of toys or luxuries. My mom still insists on keeping old things of no current value thinking they'll be useful in the future&mdash; a mentality birthed from the hardships of her past. As a result of that, I grew up very attached to my belongings because everything felt sentimental. Nowadays as an adult with her own space, I've become aware of how quickly one's living space can get cluttered. For 2020, I am going to make better decisions when it comes to the sustainability about my purchases. This means having an internal monologue about whether I need to buy _______, not forgetting to bring my own tote for groceries, and buying bio-degradable household items. While buying only the essentials is a way to keep my apartment tidy, it also creates a sense of tranquility in my mind knowing that I don't need to clutter my life with materialistic things. I've learned that my fulfillment comes from other things.

            <h1 class="major-section spacetop">
                A Year of Self-improvement
            </h1>
         
            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop extraspacebottom">
              No world-changing goals here— just simple ones that are achievable by anyone. As I get older, I start to see things in my life with more clarity. I know what it takes to make me happy. The tail end of 2019 was an eye-opening time, and 2020 is going to *hopefully* be an extension of that, where I can continue working on a better "me". I'm looking forward to making the best out of the next year while keeping these goals in mind.
