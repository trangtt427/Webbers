       <div class="twentyspace"></div>
    
      <p class="project-paragraph">
          As a side project, I worked on the redesign of the Vudu desktop website. The Vudu website caught my attention the moment I came across it, and not in a good way either.
          I felt that the Vudu interface was too cluttered. There was no hierarchical structure of information on the homepage and the images of the features were not optimized. With the shear amount of titles thrown at me on the homepage, it felt like everything was fighting for my attention.</p>    <div class="twentyspace"></div>
    
      <p class="project-paragraph">
         My goal was to help users navigate through the Vudu website, by creating a better structure on how to show the titles and features.</p>

      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
       
       
    <p class="project-paragraph">I created a persona based on the feedback of several devout streamers. This would help me step outside of myself and recognize what other people are looking for. I was able to identify a common motive: people want to watch something that they've either heard about, or is promoted with high praise somewhere on the website.</p>

            <li><strong>Occupation:</strong> Sales Development Representative</li>
             <li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li>
             <li><strong>Bio:</strong> Pibby's job requires him to be persistent and extroverted, but he's always exhausted when he comes home every evening. He also endures a 1.5hr commute on the way home. Once home, Pibby enjoys a cold beverage and unwinding with his wife and five year old son. Usually, Pibby likes action movies and comedies, but will sometimes watch other genres with his wife. On the weekends, Pibby will have a family movie night with a movie title of his son's choice.</li>
             <li><strong>User Goals:</strong> Spend less time looking for movies, wants super easy to use interface, and access to action movies in fewest amount of clicks</li>
             <li><strong>Motivations:</strong> Time, speed, and price</li>
             <li><strong>Personality Traits:</strong> Hard-working, hates thinking too hard, hates wasting time</li>
             <li><strong>Personal Devices:</strong> Macbook Pro 2016, iPhone X</li>

      <p class="project-paragraph"> I sketched out a storyboard in comic-panel style to help me visualize the interactions. This also highlights the emotions that users might have as they flow through the task.</p>

        <p class="project-paragraph">Along with the storyboard, I created a simple task flow that shows the scenario Pibby goes through to get to his goal. This flow helped me conceptualize features that should be implemented in order to improve the overall interaction.</p>

      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
     
      
       <p class="project-paragraph">I created a wireframe to emphasize the interactions and flow on the homepage. Some of the features I've implemented include:</p>
      
      
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Optimized carousel:</strong> On the current Vudu interface, there are highlighted features on the homepage, but instead of focusing on titles, it was focusing on price and genre. The images were also not optimized and are in low resolution. Instead, I would add in high quality images of single titles on each page.</li>
             <li><strong>Inline CTAs:</strong> When users click on the highlighted feature, they will see a few call to actions. This makes it easy for them to make a decision on what they want to see.</li>
            <li><strong>Snail trail:</strong> I included a snail trail scrolling for users to view content. At the end of each row, there are arrows indicating that there are more options available for that row. I also would make the last visible item darkened with an overlay to make the arrow stand out. The arrow will then move several selections across screen.</li> <li><strong>Apparent synopses:</strong> Instead of users having to delve into a title to see the information, I wanted to make certain information readily available at the surface. This makes it incredibly easy for users to see important content quickly, spending less time to make decisions. For example, users will be able to see each episode's synopsis without a lot of commitment to one title.</li>

      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
       <p class="project-paragraph">Currently, Vudu uses blue for most of their interface. In my redesign, I kept true to the Vudu brand by sticking to the blue. Primary CTAs use a blue fill while secondary CTAs do not have a fill, but a blue outline instead.</p>

   <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
   
      <p class="project-paragraph">Working on this project allowed me the opportunity to build for a less technical crowd. Because I didn't have the resources I'd get if it were a professional work project, I had to get creative about the processes by gathering information on my own terms. Although informal, I was able to gain insights and feedback from others who use streaming platforms through simple questions. I had the chance to work on a product that millions of people enjoy using.  </p>
