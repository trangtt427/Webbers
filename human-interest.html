              <p>In 2015, Human Interest (known as Captain401 at the time) kicked off the herculean task of building their own 401(k) recordkeeper to handle all plans in-house. A recordkeeper is responsible for keeping track of assets and handling investment elections, contributions, and distributions. Only the big incumbents have in-house recordkeepers&mdash;other younger 401(k) providers use a third-party recordkeeper to take care of it all.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="container pt-3">
            <div class="line-width">
                <p class="">Human Interest was also using a third-party recordkeeper at the time, but was ready to bring all of their plans onto their own recordkeeper. This would allow Human Interest to have full ownership of a their customer's 401(k) and save the company from having to pay a premium for subpar outside services. We needed to make sure that we could stand on our own two feet before abandoning our third-party recordkeeper. I was at the forefront of these efforts in helping identify what operations and tools we would need to be able to support this initiative.</p>

                  <h4 class="mb-4">Closing the Gap in Business Operations</h4>
                  <p>I support several internal teams through service design. Many of the early initiatives were around closing business gaps of having moved away from a third-party recordkeeper. One service I helped ship was a deconversion tool to help our internal teams liquidate assets for plans that want to move to a different 401(k) provider. The benefits of having a third-party recordkeeper meant that they took care of the plan transitioning, so we never had the functionalities or the workflow for this. It was nearing the end of the year, and plans who've reached out a few times to deconvert were growing restless and impatient with our inability to take care of the deconversion.</p>

                  <p class="">I partnered with Product, Deconversion Specialists and the Director of Retirement Administration to map out the major players and actions needed for this process. We worked out things like:</p>
                  <ul><li>The Plan's Letter of Intent and which team is responsible for getting this signed and communicated to the recordkeeping team</li>
                    <li>Identifying the party responsible for entering the deconversion information in our systems</li><li>Brainstorm a solution on how we liquidate assets for an entire plan</li></ul>

                  <h4 class="mb-4">One Centralized Tooling Hub for All</h4>
                  <p>One of the most challenging projects was a multiyear effort in unifying all of our disparate systems into one user-friendly operations management tool. Workflows and customer information were split across different systems, each with their own set of permissions and were built without the users in mind. Internal and Support team workstreams were wildly inefficient as tickets had to be opened in order to get the right information to the right people. We were in the middle of a massive rearchitecting of our services, so we had support from Leadership to finally tackle this longstanding challenge.</p>

                  <p>As the only designer hired to work on the product, I brought some common design tools (the Sketch-InVision-Zeplin trifecta) and frameworks into the mix to improve the process between all parties. I worked with a project manager and an engineer, partnering especially close with the former to standardize regular calls with our customers. Design eventually became an important stakeholder in these meetings, which opened the floodgates for interviewing users, workshopping sessions, and clearer requirements for Engineering. The CEO started stepping back from the waterfall way of doing things when it became clear that the new approach led to quality, user-approved solutions faster, and with less Engineering throw-away work. </p>
