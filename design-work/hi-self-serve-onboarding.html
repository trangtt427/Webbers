Most small business admins want to set up a 401(k) without talking to a person.

                  <p class="">
                    Admins signing up for our 401(k)s weren't happy being bounced between multiple salesfolk and Onboarding Specialists, a process that barely changed since the company's beginning. Every customer was forced to join a call with someone from Human Interest to finalize their plan setup&mdash;even for the simplest and most straightforward plans. This was expensive for us and frustrating for admins coming from our partner payroll provider, whose product experience is considered the gold-standard in the industry.

              <div class="container mb-7">
                    <h3 class="mb-7">The pressure was on: our partner payroll provider required us to offer a seamless self-serve sign-up experience on par with their standards. To continue being a "preferred partner", we needed to make this happen by the end of June 2023&mdash;less than five months away. </h3>

                                  <p class="mb-3">
                                    Our strategy was to double down on a subset of plans in order to make self-this achievable by the deadline. We share the same personas as the payroll provider, so we would rely on them to "pre-qualify" admins for this new experience. When signing up for a 401(k), admins are considering costs and making huge decisions around things like:
                                  </p>
                                  <ul class="mb-3"><li>Eligibility</li>
                                    <li>Employer contributions</li>
                                    <li>Minimum service required</li>
                                    <li>Vesting schedules</li>
                                    <li>Auto-enrollment (and default contribution rates)</li></ul>
                                    <p>
                                      Designing a 401(k) plan can get very nuanced and it's possible that an admin may want to customize every part of it, but we learned from our data that most tend to lean towards an industry-standard configuration.

Instead of overwhelming users with questions about designing every part of their plan from scratch, we'd offer curated plan designs of popular settings. Onboarding would just be a "click next" experience for admins, all the way through bank connection and signing plan docs.

Again, we would leverage social proof to show the value of certain decisions so that admins won't need to resort to heavier content.

                         While this initiative had the support of the board and Leadership, we weren't shielded from the everyday disruptions and chaos of being a startup. We lost engineering resources to contending fires, and required more coordinated efforts than we thought we needed from Data, Revenue Ops, and Growth because of technology limitations. This project was at the intersection of many things, but fortunately, was a big enough opportunity to get reprioritized as the company's highest initiative.
