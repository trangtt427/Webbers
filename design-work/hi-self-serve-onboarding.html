                  <p class="">
                    Admins signing up for our 401(k)s weren't happy being bounced between multiple salesfolk and onboarding specialists, a process that remained unchanged since Human Interest started. Every customer&mdash;even for the simplest and most straightforward plans&mdash;was forced to speak to a specialist in order to finish onboarding. This was expensive for us and frustrating for admins coming from our partner payroll provider, whose product experience is considered the gold-standard in the industry.

                                  <p class="mb-3">
                                    Our strategy was to double down on a subset of plans in order to make self-serve achievable by the deadline. We shared the same personas with the payroll provider, so we were relying on them to "pre-qualify" admins for this new experience. 401(k)s are wildly complex; there are thousands of possible combinations that involve:
                                  </p>
                                  <ul class="mb-3"><li>Eligibility</li>

                                    <li>Minimum service required</li>
                                    <li>Vesting</li>
                                    <li>Auto-enrollment (and default contribution rates)</li></ul>
                                    <p>
                                      It's possible that an admin may want to customize everything in their 401(k) plan, but we learned from our data that most opt for a common plan type.

We were interested in seeing if the admins could complete the flow, and what their Single Ease Question (SEQ) ratings would be. While the SEQ scores were very favorable at the end of each call, it became increasingly obvious which items would threaten our start-to-complete rate.

                             Safe Harbor is a type of 401(k) plan that allows companies to avoid regulations and expenses, but it wasn't clear in our flow. Some thought it was a company, some thought it was a Human Interest-coined term. But everyone would Google it, opening up chances for drop-off.

                         While the admin self-serve initiative had the support of the board and Leadership, we weren't shielded from the everyday disruptions and chaos of being a startup. We lost engineering resources to contending fires, and required a lot of focused coordination from teams like Data, Revenue Ops, and Growth to come up with a plan around handling Salesforce opportunities. This project was at the intersection of so much, but luckily, was a big enough opportunity to get reprioritized as the company's highest initiative.
