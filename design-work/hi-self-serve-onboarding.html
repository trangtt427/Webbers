                    Admins signing up for our 401(k)s weren't happy being bounced between multiple salesfolk and onboarding specialists, a process that remained unchanged since the company's beginning. Every customer was forced to speak with a specialist in order to finish onboarding&mdash;even for the simplest and most straightforward plans. This was expensive for us and frustrating for admins coming from our partner payroll provider, whose product experience is considered the gold-standard in the industry.

                                  <p class="mb-3">
                                    Our strategy was to double down on a subset of plans in order to make self-serve achievable by the deadline. We serve the same personas as the payroll provider, so we we would rely on them to "pre-qualify" admins for this new experience. 401(k)s are wildly complex; there are thousands of possible combinations that involve:
                                  </p>

                                      It's possible that an admin may want to customize everything in their 401(k) plan, but we learned from our data that most lean towards an industry-standard plan type.

                              With a structured research prompt in hand, clickable prototypes polished, and a framework for synthesizing insights, we were ready to see how our solutions would fare with six admin recruits. We were interested in seeing if the admins could get all the way to fake-sign their docs, and what their Single Ease Question (SEQ) ratings would be. While the SEQ scores were very favorable at the end of each call, it became increasingly obvious which items would threaten our start-to-complete rate.

                             Safe Harbor is a type of 401(k) plan that allows companies to avoid regulations and expenses, but it wasn't clear in our flow. Some thought it was a company, some thought it was a Human Interest-coined term. But everyone would Google it, opening up chances for drop-off.

                         While the admin self-serve initiative had the support of the board and Leadership, we weren't shielded from the everyday disruptions and chaos of being a startup. We lost engineering resources to contending fires, and required a lot of focused coordination from teams like Data, Revenue Ops, and Growth to come up with a plan around handling Salesforce pipeline stages. This project was at the intersection of many things, but fortunately, was a big enough opportunity to get reprioritized as the company's highest initiative.
