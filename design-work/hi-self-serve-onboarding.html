Most small businesses wanted to set up a 401(k) without needing to speak to a human.

                  <p class="">
                    Admins signing up for 401(k)s weren't happy being bounced between multiple salesfolk, a process that remained unchanged since Human Interest's inception. Every customer&mdash;even for the most simple and straightforward plans&mdash;was forced to speak to a specialist in order to finish onboarding. This was costly for the company and frustrating for admins coming from our partner payroll provider, whose product experience is considered the gold-standard in the industry.

                                  <p class="mb-3">
                                    Our strategy was to double down on a subset of plans in order to make self-serve achievable by the deadline. 401(k)s are wildly complex; there are thousands of possible combinations that involve:
                                  </p>
                                  <ul class="mb-3"><li>Eligibility</li>

                                      It's possible for admins to want to customize everything in their 401(k) plan, but we learned from our data that most opt for a common plan type. If there was a place where one option was more popular based on our data, we would default it.
