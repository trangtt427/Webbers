                        <p class="mb-5"> Admins signing up for our 401(k)s were required to meet with Onboarding Specialists to finalize their plan&mdash;even for the simplest and most straightforward plans. This process barely changed since Human Interest's beginnings, was expensive for us, and frustrated admins coming from our partner payroll provider, whose product experience is considered the gold-standard in the industry.</p>
          
                        <h3 class="mb-5">Most small business admins want to set up a 401(k) without talking to a person.</h3>
                        
                        <p class="mb-5">The pressure was on: one our biggest partner payroll providers required us to cater to admins who want self-serve. To continue being in good standing as a partner, we needed to make this happen by the end of June 2023&mdash;less than five months away. 
                        </p>
          
                          <p class="mb-2">I led the design efforts for this initiative. Some of my achievements are listed below:</p>

                <p class="mb-5">
                  There weren't enough resources or time to make self-serve happen for all customers, so it was important to double down on a subset of plans in order to make this achievable by the deadline. 
                 </p>
                <h3 class="mb-5">We wanted to target single employers who are offering their first 401(k) plan.</h3>
                <p class="mb-2">
                  We share the same personas as our partner payroll provider, so we would rely on them to pre-qualify admins for this new experience. When signing up for a 401(k), admins are considering costs and making huge decisions around things like:
                 </p>
                 <ul class="mb-5"><li>Eligibility</li>
                  <li>Employer contributions</li>
                  <li>Minimum service required</li>
                  <li>Vesting schedules</li>
                  <li>Auto-enrollment (and default contribution rates)</li></ul>
                 <p>
                  Designing a 401(k) plan can get very nuanced and it's possible that an admin may want to customize every part of it, but we learned from our data that most trend towards an industry-standard configuration. The project lead, the CXO, assembled a core team of Product Management, Product Marketing, Engineering, and myself to drive this transformation. Our goal was to have a high start-to-complete rate while delivering something that we'd be proud of.

                      I kicked off a 2.5 hour-long whiteboarding session with the CXO and Director of Product Marketing. During this exploration, we bounced ideas, shared knowledge from our respective domains, and riffed off of each another.

                    <p class="mb-6">
                      Instead of overwhelming users with questions about designing every part of their plan from scratch, we'd offer curated plan designs. Onboarding would just be a "click next" experience for admins, all the way through bank connection and signing plan docs.

                                Up until now, designs were informed mainly by our own bubble of assumptions. My Product partner and I teamed up with our UXR expert to get our designs in front of admins via moderated user studies. With a structured research prompt in hand, clickable prototypes polished, and a framework for synthesizing insights, we were ready to see how our solutions would fare with six admin recruits.
