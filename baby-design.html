              <p class="">Created a personal UI kit flexible enough to help me design a variety of interfaces
                consistently and efficiently. I'm still trying to maintain it and find ways to improve it whenever Figma
                has new releases. Available on the Figma Community. </p>

            <p class="mb-5">At work, I was using a design system that, at a glance, seemed like it had everything I
              needed. But when multiple designers started using it, we found that it wasn't as scalable as we liked, and
              the styles and components were hard to configure. We ended up slowly rebuilding parts of it to be easier
              and faster to use in the long run. </p>
            <h4 class="mb-5">After this experience, I started my own design library; one that is comprehensive,
              intuitive, and easily customizable. This personal project became lovingly known as Baby Design.</h4>
