    <h1 class="project-h1">Project Overview</h1>

       <div class="twentyspace"></div>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
      A colleague reached out to me and recruited my help to design a weather website. The idea came about because it was hurricane season at the time and we felt strongly about creating a simple but useful service that provides detailed weather information. Users can also sign up to receive email alerts whenever there are harsh weather conditions near their location. Another perk granted through signing up is that users will be able to choose which location to be set as their default location whenever they visit the website. The service is a MEAN stack application and was hosted on Amazon Web Services. We came up with the name "Weatherdog" because we wanted our mascot to be a dog, an animal highly regarded as a rescue companion during disasters.

    <h1 class="project-h1">Initial Brainstorm and Requirements</h1>

       <div class="twentyspace"></div>

    <p class="project-paragraph">
    Because it was a small team with one developer and designer, we were able to define the requirements quickly. The minimum product would be a weather website with local alerts. Along the way, we started fleshing out ideas about increments of forecasts and other types of information we can provide. We felt that displaying the highs and lows in temperature would be important, as well as wind speeds.

     <h1 class="project-h1">Researching the Trends</h1>

       <div class="twentyspace"></div>

     <p class="project-paragraph">
      As the one handling the interactions and overall look and feel of the product, I wanted to ensure that everything that appears on the website would be insightful to users. I held a few casual sessions speaking with a varied group of people. I asked them give me one or two things they care most about when it comes to weather forecasts. The most obvious and most straight forward feature that people wanted includes, of course, the current temperature. The second most important thing they mentioned was a description of the current weather.</p>

       <div class="twentyspace"></div>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
            I also spent some time looking at several different weather applications, desktop and mobile. This helped me identify certain patterns amongst these services that people tend to care most about.

     <h1 class="project-h1">Coming Up With (Perceived) Solutions</h1>

       <div class="twentyspace"></div>

     <p class="project-paragraph">
      I shared my findings with development and we started defining the architecture of the website. Using wireframes, I communicated the idea of having several KPIs on the homepage and the ability to switch between the current weather information, hourly, or several days worth. The Wunderground API provide a lot of information regarding weather, but we wanted to keep the service simple.</p>

         <div class="fortyspace"></div>



      <p class="project-paragraph">Using the wireframe, we compared the data we wanted to show with the Wunderground API. The API provides several different map widgets, and the one that we liked was a larger map than what I had anticipated. I reflected the minor changes in the high fidelity versions of the design. Also, we decided to switch the weekly view to a 10-day view because we thought by having a little bit more information displayed might be more useful.</p>

      <h1 class="project-h1">Creating the Brand</h1>

      <div class="twentyspace"></div>

      <p class="project-paragraph">We wanted to keep the interface modern, but also engagement through the touch of bold colors. Blue was the color we went with for the UI, but our secondary/accent color would be orange. I illustrated several icons to match with the Wunderland API weather descriptions, focusing on a flat, simple design. As for the Weatherdog mascot, I sketched out a few versions. The final design features a cartoon dog wearing a traditional yellow raincoat.</p>

             <p class="project-paragraph">
        Our primary method of sharing updated designs with each other include Zeplin. Logos, icons, and other source files were shared via email. There was constant collaboration during the the development process, as we ended up changing different sizes for components and fonts along the way.</p>

    <h1 class="project-h1">Results</h1>

       <div class="twentyspace"></div>

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        We shared our creation with fellow colleagues and other users, and ended up garnering a lot of positive feedback. The service was quick to load because a lot of the data has already been streamlined via Wunderground, and people made positive remarks about the overall design (the Weatherdog mascot included). The alert widget autopopulates during hazardous weather conditions, so most of the time, there weren't many alerts to be shown.</p>

             <div class="twentyspace"></div>

      <p class="project-paragraph">
        After a few years, we stopped paying for the service to be hosted on Amazon Web Services, so now it sits in a Github repository. In the future, I would want to further what Weatherdog can offer by including an effort for relief services.</p>
