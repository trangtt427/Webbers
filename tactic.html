              <p>In December 2021, I joined Tactic as a consulting designer (first designer and honorary Tactician #4) to deliver a solution that helps businesses better manage taxes for their digital assets. Crypto was starting to appear on more company balance sheets these days. In response, there were increased regulations and guidelines around how to report income on crypto activity. Not too many digital asset accounting platforms were in the market yet, especially for companies that handle about 1,000+ transactions a month.

                <p>Accountants would need to properly handle the bookkeeping and reporting, and ensure all income was tracked. Otherwise, they can get hit with hefty tax fines. I worked closely with the lead product manager and in-house accountant to understand what <i>closing the books</i>&mdash;the end goal for all accountants&mdash;look like. I was eventually able to wrap my mind around complex accounting workflows like reconciling, chart of accounts, journaling, and crypto concepts like wallets and staking.</p>

                  <h2 class="mb-4">Learning About Taxes and Crypto</h2>
                  <p> In the beginning, we relied heavily on what other companies in the market were doing (mainly Cryptio, Koinly, and CryptoTaxCalculator) and identified the problems they were solving (and for what types of customers). We were constrained with resources, but we did have our own in-house accountant as well as consultants. I held a few Q+A sessions to learn about what accountants and finance stakeholders are doing leading up to tax season. The jobs were varied, depending on the person, but everyone's goal was to ensure the numbers are all accounted for, as well as the transaction parties all labeled.

                    <p>One big point of contention are gas fees. In the world of blockchain, a gas fee refers to the cost of processing a transaction. To calculate the total gas fees and gains/losses for digital assets, accountants would have to work across multiple systems, a process that took one of our customers about 30 hours a month.</p>

                    <p>I worked closely with the Lead Product Manager to come up with ways to present information that could drive action. We indexed hard on the input from the few experts and consultants we met with, and mocked up a few prototypes to put in front of real folks. We learned that users are mostly interested in seeing their transaction history, as well as all of the associated fees and costs aggregated in one place.

                    <p>The presentation of transaction data and quick access to other bits of information were well received, but we needed to understand what the workflows will be on this page. We learned that one thing that users do often is categorizing their transactions. Each transaction must be mapped to a category, usually based on directionality, so that it gets properly accounted for in the journals. Since this is a high frequency touchpoint, I designed a solution where users can categorize transactions individually inline or via bulk.</p>

                    <p>In addition to directional categories, there are also sub-categories. For example, a transaction's direction could be considered "money in", but buy, income, and airdrop are sub-categories that fall under that. Since the system can only detect the direction, we made it easier for users to categorize by showing only the sub-category options based on a direction. If they really wanted to, users could also change the direction in an advanced workflow.</p>

                    <p>For customers with huge volumes of transactions, categorizing transactions each time is pretty labor-intensive. We took categorizing a step further, and came up with a way to automate the categorizing of transactions based on conditions. I designed a Rules feature where the system will perform an action (i.e. categorizing transactions or attaching a memo) if a transaction fulfills a certain criteria. Users have the choice to apply the rules retroactively as well, giving them full control of how they want to manage their transactions.</p>
