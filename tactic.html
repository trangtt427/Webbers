        <p class="project-paragraph">
          In December 2021, I joined Tactic as the founding designer to drive a solution that helps businesses manage their crypto accounting. We were a small team of 4 when I had joined, but were already taking on the industry's toughest but most prevalent problems. I was responsible for designing the entire product while establishing the company's Design function, which included research efforts, upskilling company-wide understanding of Design Thinking, and building our design system. I also had the privilege of working closely with the team to shape the Tactic brand and identity into what it is today.

        <p class="project-paragraph">
         Most of the complex design challenges we faced were around use cases involving huge volumes of data&mdash; <i>how might we allow users to resolve conflicts in their transactions? Should updating a rule to categorize transactions happen rectroactively?</i> I worked with accountants to understand industry-specific workflows like chart of accounts, journaling, and reconciliation. We also honed in on user decision-making behavior to help lower the barrier of entry for setting up wallets and exchanges.  While the product is tailored for businesses, we take up a consumer-friendly approach towards ensuring a product experience that is simple to use, but includes adequate educational content and guidance for anyone to catch on.

          Tactic applies principles of consumer-friendly design with enterprise-grade utility. Drawing from people's familiarity and motivations with financial wellness apps, we created an experience where users can understand the landscape of their crypto activity all in one place.
