              <p>Not too many solutions were in the market yet, especially for companies that handle 1,000+ transactions a month. I joined the team as a design consultant, and with my partner-in-crime&mdash;the lead product manager, delivered automated solutions for these companies to manage crypto taxes in a clean, compliant way.

        <p class="mt-4">One user, a Head of Finance, had his engineers pull transactions from different wallets and exchanges to manually calculate their cost-basis and fees. This tedious workflow took away valuable development time that was supposed to be spent on improving their finance infrastructure.</p>

       <div class="col col-6 ps-md-4 mb-7">
        <p class="mt-4">Users reached out to the support team for certain workflows because there was no way to do it in the product yet.

          Users wanted to do their accounting in one place, so it made sense to start mocking up a transactions page to be the source of truth.</h3>
        <p>
         The transactions page brings together financial activity from the user's various wallets and exchanges. Tactic would do the work of reconciling data, separating fees, price conversion, and calculating gains and losses.

                <h3 class="mb-4">Now that users have all this transaction data at their fingertips, what do they need to do with it?</h3>
                <p>Users were tidying up their transactions to make sure everything is mapped to the right categories so that it gets accounted for in their journals. Since this is a high frequency touchpoint, I designed a lightweight interaction where users can apply categories efficiently by doing it inline or via bulk.

                <h3 class="mb-4">Categorizing even in bulk would still be manual. Because many transactions are categorized the same way because of their addresses and wallets, we came up with an even better way handle this: automate via rules.</h3>
                <p>I designed a Rules engine to allow automatic actions to take place through certain logic. For example, all transactions containing Ethereum and under a certain dollar amount could be assigned specific category. Users have the choice to apply the rules retroactively as well, giving them full control of how they want to manage their transactions.

          Users can now self-serve when it comes to mapping their Chart of Accounts.</h3>
        <p>
          Previously, users needed Tactic intervention to configure their ledger mapping. I designed an experience for them to map tokens to their appropriate ledger accounts, including ways to granularly map their assets to sub-accounts.
