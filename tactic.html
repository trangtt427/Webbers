        <h2>Crypto started to appear on more balance sheets, but there weren't too many solutions in the market that truly help companies wrangle taxes for thousands of monthly transactions.</h2>
        <p>Companies dealing with crypto were at risk of IRS audits and huge fines if they weren't confident with their accounting. I joined the team as the first designer and, with my partner-in-crime—the lead product manager, brought automated solutions that helped businesses do their taxes in a clean, compliant way.</p>
