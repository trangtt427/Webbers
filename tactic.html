            <p class="">Tactic is a crypto accounting platform that helps finance teams close their books. I led the design of all product surfaces, innovating to make the accounting process as painless as possible. The company was eventually acquired by TaxBit in 2022.</p>

              <p class>Crypto was starting to appear on more balance sheets, but there weren't too many digital asset tax solutions in the market to help companies wrangle the accounting of thousands of monthly crypto transactions. </p>

      <h2 class="mb-5">Early Insights</h2>
      <p class="mb-5">
        We had a few reliable sources to start our research with; our own in-house accountant and a few willing customer friendlies.
       </p>
      <h3 class="mb-5">For one customer, it takes them about 40 hours per month to run the accounting process end to end.</h3>
      <p class="mb-5">
        A Head of Finance had his engineers pull transactions from different wallets and exchanges to manually calculate their cost-basis and fees. This workflow took away valuable development time that was supposed to be spent on building important business functions, like their finance infrastructure.
       </p>
       <h3 class="mb-5">There was a lack of self-serve functionalities for users.</h3>
       <p>
        Users of the platform often reached out to the support team for things that couldn't be done in the product. Things like mapping a chart of accounts is only possible by contacting Tactic and having the Engineering team set this up manually. The customer base was small enough for the team to handle such requests, but as the company scales, this would quickly become unsustainable.

        <h2 class="mb-5">Design</h2>
        <p class="mb-5">
          Users needed a clean way to see all of their transaction history in one place so that they can provide accurate reporting.
         </p>
        <h3 class="mb-5">
We introduced a transactions page, enriched with details to help users make sense of their numbers. 
        </h3>
        <p class>
         The transactions page brings together financial activity from the user's various wallets and exchanges. Tactic would do the work of reconciling data, separating fees, price conversion, and calculating gains and losses.

        </div>

        <div class="row body-section">
    <p class="mb-6">We learned that it was important for people to map their transactions to the right categories so that they get accounted for in their journals. Since this is a high frequency touchpoint, I designed a lightweight interaction where users can apply categories efficiently by doing it inline or via bulk.</p></div>

      <h3 class="mb-5">
        We came up with a way to provide even more value: automating with rules. 
                </h3></div>

                <div class="row body-section mb-6">
<p class>I designed a rules workflow to allow automatic actions to take place through certain logic. For example, all transactions containing Ethereum and are under a certain dollar amount could be assigned specific category. Once transactions come in, users won't have to touch them and can just let their rules do the work. These rules could be applied retroactively as well, giving users full control of how they want to manage their transactions.

                  Complete onboarding and setup within the app is now possible, unblocking users and giving our internal team some breathing room.</h3>

                  <p class="mb-6"> The new experience is designed to index high on guidance and efficiency. From getting their exchanges and wallets set up to mapping the chart of accounts, users are now empowered to get their job done without having to jump on a call with someone from Tactic. </p></div>
