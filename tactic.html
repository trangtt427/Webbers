              <p>In December 2021, I joined Tactic as a consulting founding designer (honorary employee #4) to deliver a solution that helps businesses better manage taxes for their digital assets. Crypto was starting to appear on more company balance sheets these days. In response, there were increased regulations and guidelines around how to report income on crypto activity. Not too many digital asset accounting platforms were in the market yet, especially for companies that handle about 1,000+ transactions a month.

                <p>Accountants would need to properly handle the bookkeeping and reporting, and ensure all the numbers make sense. Otherwise, they can get hit with hefty tax fines. I worked closely with the lead product manager and in-house accountant to understand what <i>closing the books</i>&mdash;the end goal for all accountants&mdash;look like. I was eventually able to wrap my mind around complex accounting workflows like reconciling, chart of accounts, journaling, and crypto concepts like wallets and staking.</p>

                    <p>In the world of blockchain, a gas fee refers to the cost of processing a transaction. To calculate the total gas fees and gains/losses for digital assets, accountants would have to work across multiple systems, a process that took one of our customers about 40 hours a month. With Tactic, our users are able to bring in all of their transactions through seamless integration of their exchanges, sources, and wallets, consolidating everything into a single UI. Accountants and key finance stakeholders can then track the performance of their crypto activity and get access to reports instantly.</p>

                <div class="line-width">
                    <p>Each transaction must be mapped to a category, usually based on directionality, so that it gets properly accounted for in the journals. Since this is a high frequency touchpoint, I designed a solution where users can categorize transactions individually inline or via bulk.</p>

                    <p>In addition to directional categories, there are also sub-categories. For example, a transaction's direction could be considered "money in", but buy, income, and airdrop are sub-categories that fall under that. Since the system can only detect the direction, we made it easier for users to categorize by showing only the sub-category options based on a direction. If they really wanted to, users could also change the direction in an advanced workflow.</p>

                    <p>For customers with huge volumes of transactions, categorizing transactions each time is pretty labor-intensive. We came up with a way to automate the categorizing of transactions based on conditions. With our Rules feature, the system will perform an action (i.e. categorizing transactions or attaching a memo) if a transaction fulfills a certain criteria. Users have the choice to apply the rules retroactively as well, giving them full control of how they want to manage their transactions.</p>
