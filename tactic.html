            <p class=""> Companies dealing with crypto were
              at risk of IRS audits and huge fines if they weren't confident with their accounting. I joined the team as the first designer and, with my
              partner-in-crimeâ€”the lead product manager, brought automated solutions that helped businesses do their
              taxes in a clean, compliant way. </p>
