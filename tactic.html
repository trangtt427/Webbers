              <p>I joined Tactic in 2021 as a consulting designer (first designer and honorary Tactician #4) to help bring their crypto accounting platform to the market. Crypto was starting to appear on more company balance sheets these days, so that meant more regulations and guidelines around how to report income on them. Not too many digital asset accounting platforms were in the market yet, especially for companies that handle about 1,000+ transactions a month.

                <p>Companies that deal with crypto needed a more efficient and reliable approach to bookkeeping and reporting, otherwise they can get hit with hefty tax fines. I partnered with the lead product manager and in-house accountant to understand what <i>closing the books</i>&mdash;the end goal for all accountants&mdash;look like. I was eventually able to wrap my mind around complex accounting workflows like reconciling, chart of accounts, journaling, and crypto concepts like wallets and staking.</p>

                  <p> In the beginning, we relied heavily on what other companies were doing (mainly Cryptio, Koinly, and CryptoTaxCalculator) and identified the problems they were solving&mdash;and for what types of customers. We were constrained with resources, but we did have our own accountant as well as a few customer friendlies to learn from. I held a few Q+A sessions to better understand what accountants and finance stakeholders do ahead of tax season. The workstreams varied depending on the person, but the goal remained the same: manage finances in a clean and compliant way.

                    <p>It was clear that users needed all of their crypto transactions visible in one place, as well as a high level view of their treasury. I ideated with the lead product manager to come up with ways to present this information. We indexed hard on input from the few experts and customers we met with, and mocked up prototypes to put in front of real folks. I created a Transactions UI that pulled transaction data from different systems, including gas fees and costs.

                    <p>One thing we learned was that users often categorize their transactions. Each transaction must be mapped to a category, usually based on directionality, so that it gets properly accounted for in their journals. Since this is a high frequency touchpoint, I designed an interaction where users can categorize transactions individually inline or via bulk.</p>

                    <p>In addition to directional categories, there are also sub-categories. For example, a transaction's direction could be considered "money in", but buy, income, and airdrop are sub-categories that fall under that. Since the system can only detect the direction, we made it easier for users to categorize by showing only the sub-categories based on a direction. If they really wanted to, users could also change the direction in an advanced workflow.</p>

                    <p>For customers with huge volumes of transactions, categorizing new transactions each time could get tiring. We took the feature a step further, and came up with a way to automate the categorizing of transactions based on conditions. I designed a Rules feature where the system will perform an action (i.e. categorizing transactions or attaching a memo) if a transaction fulfills a certain criteria. Users have the choice to apply the rules retroactively as well, giving them full control of how they want to manage their transactions.</p>
