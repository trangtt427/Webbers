              <p>Crypto was starting to appear on more company balance sheets these days, so that meant more regulations and guidelines around how to report income on them. Not too many intuitive solutions were in the market yet, especially for companies that handle about 1,000+ transactions a month. Tactic, a start-up with just the 4 of us at the time, aimed to solve this. I joined as a design consultant, and with my partner-in-crime&mdash;the lead product manager, we delivered elaborate end-to-end solutions for b2b companies to manage crypto taxes in a clean, compliant way.

                  <p> In the beginning, we poked around at what other companies were doing (mainly Cryptio, Koinly, and CryptoTaxCalculator) and identified the problems they were solving&mdash;and for what types of customers. We were constrained with resources, but had our own accountant and a few customer friendlies to learn from. I held Q+A sessions to better understand what accountants and finance stakeholders do ahead of tax season.

                    <p>One user, a Head of Finance, had his engineers pull transactions across different wallets and exchanges to manually calculate their cost-basis and fees.

Much of this was done by contacting Tactic and having the Product and Engineering teams handle this in the backend. It was manageable with the number of customers we had at the time, but would obviously not be sustainable as we grow.</p>

                     We indexed hard on input from the few experts and customers we met with, and mocked up prototypes to put in front of real folks. I designed several features, with key solutions that gave users a high level view of their crypto activity and ways to organize that data.

                    <p>One thing we learned was that users were often tidying up their transactions. Each transaction must be mapped to a category, usually based on directionality, so that it gets properly accounted for in their journals. Since this is a high frequency touchpoint, I designed a lightweight interaction where users can apply categories efficiently by doing it inline or via bulk.</p>

                <div class="line-width mb-5">
                    <p>In addition to directional categories, there are also sub-categories. For example, a transaction's direction could be considered "money in", but "buy", "income", and "airdrop" are sub-categories that fall under that. Since the system can only detect the direction, we made it easier for users to categorize by showing only the sub-categories based on that direction. If they really wanted to, users could also overwrite these in an advanced workflow.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">For customers with lots of transactions, categorizing each one would be a nightmare. We enhanced this feature even further, and came up with a way to automate this step based on conditions. I designed a Rules feature where the system performs an action (i.e. categorizing transactions or attaching a memo) if a transaction fulfills a certain criteria. Users have the choice to apply the rules retroactively as well, giving them full control of how they want to manage their transactions.</p>
