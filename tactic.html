              <p>In December 2021, I joined Tactic as a consulting founding designer (employee #4) to deliver a solution that helps businesses better manage taxes for their digital assets. Crypto was starting to appear on more company balance sheets these days. In response, there were increased regulations and guidelines around how to report income on crypto activity. There weren't too many digital asset accounting software in the market yet, especially for companies that handle about 1,000+ transactions a month.

                <p>In order for these companies to stay on top of tax reporting, accountants would need to have their transactions categorized properly, contacts maintained, and gains/losses tracked. Not doing any of these could result in inaccurate reporting and eventually lead to some hefty tax penalties. I worked closely with our in-house accountant and lead product manager to understand what "closing the books" looks like. I was eventually able to wrap my mind around complex accounting workflows like reconciling, chart of accounts, and journaling, and crypto concepts like wallets and staking.</p>

                    <h4 class="mb-4">Simple UI for Actionable Insights</h4>
                    <p>To calculate the total gas fees and gains/losses for digital assets, accountants would have to work across multiple systems, a process that took one of customers about 40 hours a month. With Tactic, our users are able to bring in all of their transactions through seamless integrations of their exchanges, sources, and wallets, consolidating everything into a single UI. Accountants and key finance stakeholders can then track the performance of their crypto activity and get access to their data instantly.</p>

                    <p>In traditional accounting, a transaction must be mapped to a category so that it gets properly accounted for. Every transaction pulled into Tactic gets categorized based on directionality, but sometimes, the category needs to be a bit more specific. If an accountant needs to go into their app every day, it's because of this. Since this is a high frequency touchpoint, I designed a solution where users can easily categorize individual transactions inline or in bulk. </p>

                    <h4 class="mb-4">Saving Hours by Automating with Rules</h4>
                    <p>Accountants will already know what category a transaction should be based on several parameters like token, from/to address, source, function, etc. For customers with huge volumes of transactions, categorizing transactions each time is pretty labor-intensive. We came up with a way to pre-empt uncategorized transactions based on logic. With our Rules feature, the system will perform an action (like categorizing transactions or attaching a memo) if a transaction fulfills a custom criteria. Users have the choice to apply the rules retroactively as well, giving them full control of how they want to manage their transactions.</p>
