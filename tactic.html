              <p>Crypto was starting to appear on more company balance sheets these days, so that meant more regulations and guidelines around how to report income on them. Not too many intuitive solutions were in the market yet, especially for companies that handle about 1,000+ transactions a month. Tactic aimed to offer solutions for these companies. I partnered very closely with the lead product manager to design end-to-end solutions for managing digital asset taxes in a clean and compliant way.

                  <p> In the beginning, we poked around at what other companies were doing (mainly Cryptio, Koinly, and CryptoTaxCalculator) and identified the problems they were solving&mdash;and for what types of customers. We were constrained with resources, had our own accountant as well as a few customer friendlies to learn from. I held a few Q+A sessions to better understand what accountants and finance stakeholders do ahead of tax season.

                    <p>One thing we learned was that users often categorize their transactions. Each transaction must be mapped to a category, usually based on directionality, so that it gets properly accounted for in their journals. Since this is a high frequency touchpoint, I designed an interaction where users can categorize transactions individually inline or via bulk.</p>

                    <p>In addition to directional categories, there are also sub-categories. For example, a transaction's direction could be considered "money in", but buy, income, and airdrop are sub-categories that fall under that. Since the system can only detect the direction, we made it easier for users to categorize by showing only the sub-categories based on a direction. If they really wanted to, users could also change the direction in an advanced workflow.</p>

                    <p>For customers with huge volumes of transactions, categorizing new transactions each time could get tiring. We took the feature a step further, and came up with a way to automate the categorizing of transactions based on conditions. I designed a Rules feature where the system will perform an action (i.e. categorizing transactions or attaching a memo) if a transaction fulfills a certain criteria. Users have the choice to apply the rules retroactively as well, giving them full control of how they want to manage their transactions.</p>
