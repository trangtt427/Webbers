            <h4 class="">Squarespace acquired Acuity in 2021 and integrated the B2C offering into their suite of tools, but not the enterprise version. This left our largest customers with a hugely fragmented product and lack of basic management and security features.</h4>

              <p class="mb-5">We faced 3 major challenges specific to our part of the business:</p>
              <li class="list-point bigp mb-3">
                <div>Acuity Scheduling was founded on the promise of serving small business owners&mdash;people who only use a single scheduling instance. No infrastructure existed to efficiently support bigger customers with complex needs like multiple scheduling instances and users. The Acuity Enterprise offering barely resembled a true enterprise-grade product. </div>
              </li>
              <li class="list-point bigp mb-3">Depending on what Acuity plan you use, the same features could live in different parts of the product, due to Enterprise being built with monolithic technology.</li>
              <li class="list-point bigp">My joining the newly formed Enterprise Team marked us being a fully staffed squad (or triad, as Squarespace likes to call it). We knew we had to move fast to build up processes and relationships with stakeholders from nearly every Acuity department.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="row mb-7 line-width">
            <h4 class="">Our team's goal was to deliver an enterprise product that helps current customers scale their business, close contracts, and is unified with the rest of the Squarespace experience.</h4>
