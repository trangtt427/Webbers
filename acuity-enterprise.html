              Acuity users were split between two versions of the product&mdash;"Legacy" and "Squarespace", with Enterprise customers using the former. A lot of technical and foundational work was needed to get Enterprise customers onto Squarespace's Acuity to unlock building enterprise-grade features like SSO, multi-location scheduling tools, and user management.</p>
