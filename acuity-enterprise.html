          <div class="row mb-4 line-width">
            <h3 class="">Acuity didn't fully integrate into the Squarespace ecosystem after the acquisition, leaving its largest customers with a severely fragmented product that lacked basic user management and security features.</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="row mb-10 line-width">
              <p class="mb-4">We faced 3 major challenges specific to our part of the business:</p>
              <p class="mb-4">There was no technology in place to efficiently support large customer needs like multiple scheduling instances for different locations and departments.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">The codebase was a hodgepodge of Acuity, Squarespace, and custom one-off code.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">The Enterprise team had to move fast to build up processes and relationships with stakeholders from nearly every Acuity department.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="row mb-10 smol-line-width">
            <h3 class="">Our business goal was to deliver an enterprise product that helps customers scale their business, close contracts, and is unified with the rest of the Squarespace experience.</h3>
          </div>
          <p class="subject-white mb-4">Impact</p>
          <div class="row mb-7 line-width">
            <h3 class="mb-4">The new Acuity Enterprise experience launched in August 2024.</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">Customers who were still in the sales cycle while this launched onboarded with the new experience. Previously, account managers had to heavily be involved with helping set Acuity up for customers, but org managers could now do this all on their own. I'm currently working on a migration plan for Q1 2025 to bring the rest of our customers over to the new experience while focusing on introducing SSO.</p>
            <p>I purposely skipped the details on this project because it's NDA protected. Please reach out to learn more.</p>
