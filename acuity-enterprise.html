              Acuity was sitting atop two versions of technologies&mdash;"Legacy"; a monolith that made it difficult to build new features, and "Squarespace"; a scalable codebase with modern security considerations. Acuity B2C users were on Squarespace, but Enterprise users were stuck with the former. The objective for 2023 was to rebuild the Enterprise product using the Squarespace stack to unlock features like org-level SSO, multi-location scheduling tools, and user management.</p>

               I audited parts of the product that would be affected by moving over to Squarespace's Acuity, created design visions and evaluated them with customers and their lookalikes, and supported the team through all the UX changes that came with integrating into the Squarespace ecosystem.
