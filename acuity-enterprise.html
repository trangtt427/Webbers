          <div class="row mb-4 line-width">
            <h3 class="">Acuity never fully integrated into the Squarespace ecosystem after its acquisition, leaving our largest customers with a severely fragmented product that lacked basic user management and security features.</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="row mb-10 line-width">
              <p class="mb-4">We faced 3 major challenges specific to our part of the business:</p>
              <p class="mb-4">There was no model to efficiently support bigger customers with complex needs like multiple scheduling instances and users.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">Depending on what Acuity plan you use, the same features could live in different parts of the product, due to separate technologies.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">The Enterprise team had to move fast to build up processes and relationships with stakeholders from nearly every Acuity department.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="row mb-10 smol-line-width">
            <h3 class="">Our business goal was to deliver an enterprise product that helps current customers scale their business, close contracts, and is unified with the rest of the Squarespace experience.</h3>
