            <h3 class="">Acuity didn't fully integrate into the Squarespace ecosystem after the acquisition, leaving its largest customers with a severely fragmented product that lacked basic user management and security features.</h3>

          <div class="row mb-10 line-width">
              <p class="mb-4">Users who manage Acuity for their business, Org Managers, suffer the most with this gap. They are forced to create passwords and unsafely share them in order to onboard users to their orgs.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">Account managers who support our Enterprise customers spend a ridiculous amount of time duplicating instances for customers to scale for multiple locations, because customers can't do it themselves in the product.</p>
              <p class="mb-4">As the Lead Designer on the Enterprise triad, I led generative research into understanding our growing base of users, created design solutions and evaluated them with customers and lookalikes, and supported the team through all the UX changes that took place when implementing Squarespace code and technologies.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-4">I helped launch a flurry of improvements to the Enterprise experience, and a newly designed dashboard that housed it all.</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">The features I designed for the new Enterprise experience included:</p>
            <p class="mb-4">A self-serve user invite and management experience</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Several new features to support multi-location scheduling and organization-level management</p>
            <p class="mb-4">The Enterprise Dashboard, a product exclusive to Organization Managers to oversee their scheduling operations</p>
            <p class="mb-4">SSO flows (this one helped close a few deals that year)</p>
