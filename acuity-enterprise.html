            <p class="mb-5"> This meant that many of the user management workflows and settings lived in different places, depending on which version of the product was being used.

            <p> When designing a 401(k) plan, an admin can customize almost anything, but years of industry trends and
              insights suggested a few standard configurations that plans tend to lean towards. We aimed to offer
              curated plans based on those conventions to limit choice paralysis.</p>

              <p> If admins answered "no" to any of these questions (which is uncommon), it would mean that their plans
