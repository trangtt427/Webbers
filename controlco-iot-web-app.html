                Controlco brings together building systems and networks through
                a web-based IoT app that lets users control their facility
                operations. The app consists of data visualizations and HVAC
                settings that are automated to maintain favorable temperatures
                and conditions in commercial buildings.

              <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop">The Problem</p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                User-centered design wasn't practiced at Controlco, and as a
                result, features were being added without truly empathizing with
                users and understanding their day-to-day workflow. After
                receiving enough feedback from users about how "primitive" our
                app was, the VP of Product made a commitment to improve our
                design and overall experience for users.

                their 30 - 60s and come from blue collar backgrounds. From
                working closely with them, I've learned that most of our users

                I reached out to two users from the shared workspace company
                that we were building for. Through RingCentral video calls, the
                PM and I were able to observe how they were using the Controlco
                application.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                As users were talking me through what they do on the app, they
                didn't hold back any opinions. The first screen they see is
                supposedly the "homescreen", but is actually a duplicate of the
                HVAC screen. Users complained about not having a high-level view
                of their entire system's health, so they would click page by
                page to see certain statuses of each individual unit. They also
                pointed out that creating a schedule was tedious because there
                were extraneous actions involved for something so simple like
                creating schedules.

                While users called out the product's bad visual design choices
                and clunky experience, they also made it clear that they did not
                want something drastically different and "flashy". Learnability
                was a concern for them because they are not a technical
                audience. My response was that the

                In order to help users, the biggest action item we proposed was
                to design a homepage that shows all the high-level data points.
                What we didn't want to do was remove all things familiar to the
                user. Some pages would require a facelift, while others would
                require a complete redesign. I went through the existing app and
                audited interaction patterns that need improvements.

                Some interaction patterns have been changed on the Schedule

                I met with the engineers and PM to talk about the wireframes to
                ensure that the design was within reason given the timeline and
                bandwidth. There were no challenges on either end, but I found
                out from the PM that this client is integrating another facility
                that has a central plant. We would need to redesign the homepage
                to scale and reflect other properties that contain such systems.
                I received input from the PM about what data points they would
                want to see regarding the central plant and made the changes in
                my designs.

                Since we didn't have a design standard in place, I explored some
                options for our color palette and type. I had some proposals
                from the VP, saying specifically that the app should be a
                lighter interface since many of our other products use dark
                blues. We couldn't think of a scenario where that would be an
                issue, so we ran with it. I was careful to make sure that none
                of the colors would coincide with the current colors we were
                using for statuses, and that everything had enough contrast to
                be readable.

                We tested several typefaces, but ended up using Avenir Medium
                for body content because of its scalability on the mobile
                version. Avenir Condensed was used for styling our labels.

                After we reviewed the build internally with no issues, we rolled
                it out for the customer of one site. To test out the workflow of
                the most common user scenarios, I ran a few
                <strong>guerrilla-styled usability tests</strong> with some of
                the technicians. I recruited six participants and had three of
                them perform tasks on the old interface, while the three
                participants performed the same tasks using the new design.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                The users were to do the following:

                  event class "Override", start time is "this time", end time
                  mode is "sunrise", and end time is "2:30pm", end date is

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                For users using the legacy system, the average time it took to
                complete the two tasks, respectively, were 2.44 seconds and
                25.32 seconds. For the new interface, users completed the tasks
                in 1.02 seconds and 20.21 seconds. Although by a small margin,
                users completed their common tasks faster with the newly
                redesigned interface.

                I felt that Controlco made an earnest effort to start applying
                user-centered design approaches and testing methods by allowing
                me to take the project from end to end. The VP regarded it as a
                shift towards a new paradigm of Controlco's products. If given
                another shot to revisit the product with more resources, I would
                have focused on the microinteractions involving the HVAC pages.
                There were so many things that could have been improved, but we
                were slammed with different priorities and didn't have the
                resources to completely overhaul major chunks of the platform.
