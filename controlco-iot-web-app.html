                  Controlco brings together building systems and networks
                  through a web-based IoT app that lets users control their
                  facility operations. The app consists of data visualizations
                  and HVAC systems where settings can be changed to maintain
                  favorable temperatures and conditions in commercial buildings.

                <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                  Before I came on, there was no user-centric design, and as a
                  result, users were left with a Frankenstein product that met
                  the bare minimum of being functional. Features were being
                  added without truly empathizing with users and understanding
                  their stories. After receiving enough feedback from users
                  about how "primitive" our app was, the VP of Product made a
                  commitment to improve our design and overall experience for
                  users.

                  mostly males between their 30 - 60s and come from blue collar
                  backgrounds. In my experience working within the industry,

                <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                  I reached out to two users from the shared workspace company
                  whom we are building for. Through RingCentral video calls, the
                  PM and I were able to observe the behavior from watching their
                  screens.

                <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                  As users were talking me through what they do on the app, they
                  also specified certain pain points. Right when a user logs in,
                  the first screen they see is supposedly the "homescreen", but
                  is actually a duplicate of the HVAC screen. The users said
                  that they didn't have a high-level view of their entire
                  system's health, so they would click page by page to see the
                  status of each individual unit. Users also pointed out that
                  creating a schedule was tedious because there were many clicks
                  involved due to our use of dropdowns for picking between AM
                  and PM, for example.

                  While users called out the product's bad visual design choices
                  and clunky experience, they also made it clear that they did
                  not want something drastically different and "flashy".
                  Learnability was especially a concern for them because they
                  are not a technical audience. My response was that the
                  redesign would simplify the processes and reduce the effort
                  needed to get their jobs done.

                  I produced a wireframe of the homepage to show how many units
                  are offline/online/faulty. There were other important KPIs
                  like temperature and humidity which users specifically asked
                  to see. This allows users to see the most useful bits of
                  information immediately without having to sift through
                  everything to find out what's wrong.

                  I met with the engineers and PM to talk about the wireframes

                  end, but I found out from the PM that this client is
                  integrating another facility that has a central plant. We
                  would need to redesign the homepage to scale and reflect other
                  properties that contain such systems. I received input from
                  the PM about what data points they would want to see regarding
                  the central plant and made the changes in my designs.

                  Since we didn't have a unified design guide in place, I
                  explored some options for our color palette and type. I had
                  some proposals from the VP, saying specifically that the app
                  should be a lighter interface since many of our other products
                  use dark blues. We couldn't think of a scenario where that
                  would be an issue, so we went ahead with the proposal. I was
                  careful to make sure that none of the colors would coincide
                  with the current colors we were using for statuses, and that
                  everything had enough contrast to be readable.

                  most common user scenarios, I ran a few
                  <strong>guerrilla-styled usability tests</strong> with some of
                  the technicians. I recruited six participants and had three of
                  them perform tasks on the old interface, while the three
                  participants performed the same tasks using the new design.

                  was much easier to use, and that the redesign made the app
                  much more "pleasant" to deal with. One data modeler even said

                <p class="project-paragraph">
                  I felt that Controlco made an earnest effort to integrate
                  user-centric design approaches and testing methods by allowing
                  me to take the project from end to end. The VP regarded it as
                  a shift towards a new paradigm of Controlco's products. If
                  given another opportunity to revisit the product, I would have
                  focused on the microinteractions involved navigation and
                  configurating on the HVAC specific-pages.
