              <h2 class="project-h2">Project Background</h2>


   <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">Our product is a web-based IoT app that lets users control and maintain their commercial facilities. Before I came along, engineers were designing the product, and as a result, our users were left with a Frankenstein product that was clunky and inconsistent all over. End users were getting increasingly frustrated and gave feedback to the PMs and VP of Product saying that the app was "primitive". Not long after, the VP committed a roadmap item that would improve the overall product experience.</p>


        <img class="project-image" src="images/controlco-iot-web-app/officespace1.jpg"><p class="caption spacebottom">The old UI was built without any involvement of designers.</p>



          <img class="project-image" src="images/controlco-iot-web-app/officespace3.jpg"><p class="caption spacebottom">There was no design library. So many different fonts and colors were being used without any justifiable reasoning..</p>






          <img class="project-image" src="images/controlco-iot-web-app/officespace2.jpg"><p class="caption">Too many nested options made it difficult for users.</p>

     <h1 class="project-h2">Role</h1>


      <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">As the sole UX designer in the company, I led the redesign efforts with a team consisting of a product manager, front-end engineer, and systems engineer. I was also responsible for conducting interviews with external and internal users.</p>

              <h2 class="project-h2">Learning About the User</h2>


      <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
  The power users of our app are technicians who oversee their facilities' HVAC operations. A user's day consists of going into the app to mainly look for faulty air handler units, lighting systems, and alarms. When something is not behaving as it should, users must override settings to put things back into equilibrium. While it does not stop them from doing their job, users complained of the interaction patterns and brought up our poor visual design choices.</p>



        <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
      Users also made it clear that they did not want something drastically different and "flashy". Learnability was especially a concern for them because they are not a technical audience. My response was that the redesign would address their concerns and will simplify the efforts needed from their end to carry out their tasks.</p>

      <h1 class="project-h2">Planning</h1>



      <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
      We spent some time figuring out where our efforts should be going into. What we didn't want to do was remove all things familiar to the user. For many of the pages, their functionalities would remain the same, but would have a major facelift. To help users, we wanted to start off with a homepage that conveyed the overall status of the HVAC units. I went through the existing app and audited the interaction patterns that needed to be removed. </p>

      <h1 class="project-h2">Project Goals</h1>



      <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
      There are 2 things that users wanted to do: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create schedules quickly</li>
            <li>See overall health of their facilities data</li>
        </ol>

      <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
       In order to help users, my goals are to simplify the way users create schedules and to create an overview dashboard for users on the homepage. This also means enhancing the experience of the application by incorporating familiar interaction patterns. </p>

              <h2 class="project-h2">Prototyping the Solution</h2>


      <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
I illustrated the concept of a homescreen dashboard and the flow of schedule creation. The mockup was designed to show the statuses of the HVAC units as well as active alerts. This allows users to see the most useful bits of information immediately without having to go through page by page to find what's wrong.</p>


<img class="project-image" src="images/controlco-iot-web-app/homepage-lofi.png">
<p class="caption spacebottom">V1: The first version of the homepage. I found out that integrating a second facility was in the works for this customer, which has a central plant system. The design was iterated to take that into account.</p>

<img class="project-image" src="images/controlco-iot-web-app/homepage-lofi-plant.png">
<p class="caption spacebottom">V2: The second version of the homepage. If a facility has a central plant (heating or cooling), the backend would detect those data points and auto-populate on the UI.</p>

<img class="project-image" src="images/controlco-iot-web-app/schedule-flow.png">
<p class="caption">Some interaction patterns have been changed on the Schedule screen so that users didn't have to click so many times.</p>


<p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
After a second loop of feedback, the PM and VP agreed that the design was a great solution to our users' problems.</p>

              <h2 class="project-h2">Visual Design</h2>


      <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
Since we didn't have a unified design guide in place, I explored some options for our color palette and type. I had some proposals from the VP, saying specifically that the app should be a lighter interface since many of our other products use dark blues. We couldn't think of a scenario where that would be an issue, so we went ahead with the proposal. I was careful to make sure that none of the colors would coincide with the current colors we were using for statuses, and that everything had enough contrast to be readable.</p>



        <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
      We tested several typefaces, but ended up using Avenir Medium for body content because of its scalability on the mobile version. Avenir Condensed was used for styling our labels.</p>

  <p class="caption">The UI for a facility without a central plant.</p>

        <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
        To test out the workflow of the most common user scenarios, I ran a few guerrilla-styled usability tests with some of the technicians. I recruited six participants and had three of them perform tasks on the old interface, while the three participants performed the same tasks using the new structure.</p>

        <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
        The users were to do the following: </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Report how many units are occupied</li>
            <li>Add the following event to August 1, 2017: Event named "cats", event class "Override", start time is "this time", end time mode is "sunrise", and end time is "2:30pm", end date is "August 9, 2017."</li>
        </ol>


        <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
        For user using the legacy system, the average time it took to complete the two tasks, respectively, were 2.44 seconds and 25.32 seconds. For the new interface, users completed the tasks in 1.02 seconds and 20.21 seconds. Although by a small margin, users completed their common tasks faster with the newly redesigned interface.</p>

       <h1 class="project-h2">The Outcome</h1>


      <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
        The final product was warmly received by all stakeholders (VP, engineering, and data modelers). People said that it was much easier to use, and that the redesign made the app much more "pleasant" to deal with. One data modeler even said that the new interface was easy to use and reminded him of his daughter's iPad game. The customers ended up using this design as the standard for all enterprise level projects in their portfolio.</p>

        <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
        This redesigned application gained a lot of attention from other prospects who viewed our case studies. The VP regarded it as a shift towards a new paradigm to incorporate more user-centric approaches. The project was particularly important to me because I was able to own it end to end.</p>
