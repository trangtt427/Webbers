              Controlco brings together building systems and networks through a
              web-based IoT app that allows users full control of their facility
              operations. Before I came on, there was no user-centric design,
              and as a result, users were left with a Frankenstein product that
              met the bare minimum of being functional. Features were being
              added without truly empathizing with users and understanding their
              stories. After receiving enough feedback from users about how
              "primitive" our app was, the VP of Product made a commitment to
              improve our design and overall experience for users.

              As the sole UX designer in the company, I led the redesign efforts
              with a team consisting of a product manager, front-end engineer,
              and systems engineer. In this role, I also conducted interviews
              with external and internal users.

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              The power users of our app are technicians who oversee their
              facilities' HVAC operations. A user's day consists of going into
              the app to mainly look for faulty air handler units, lighting
              systems, and alarms. When something is not behaving as it should,
              users must override settings to put things back into equilibrium.
              Even though it didn't stop them from doing their jobs, users
              complained of the interaction patterns and brought up our poor
              visual design choices.
            </p>

            <div class="thought">
              The app definitely looks bad and is pretty clunky, but I'm used to
              it now. I don't want to spend a lot of time relearning everything.

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              While users called out the product's lack of visual design chops
              and clunky experience, users also made it clear that they did not
              want something drastically different and "flashy". Learnability
              was especially a concern for them because they are not a technical
              audience. My response was that the redesign would address their
              concerns and reduce the effort needed to get their jobs done. In
              terms of business goals, a better performing app will give us a
              competitive edge over other companies vying for customers.

                      manually count how many units are offline, online, etc.

              pages would require a facelift, while only a few would require a
              full on redesign. I went through the existing app and audited
              interaction patterns that needed to be thought out better.

              I produced a wireframe of the homepage and the flow of schedule
              creation. The homepage shows how many units are
              offline/online/faulty. There were other important KPIs like
              temperature and humidity. This allows users to see the most useful
              bits of information immediately without having to go page by page
              to find out what's wrong.

              that into account.

              Since we didn't have a unified design guide in place, I explored
              some options for our color palette and type. I had some proposals
              from the VP, saying specifically that the app should be a lighter
              interface since many of our other products use dark blues. We
              couldn't think of a scenario where that would be an issue, so we
              went ahead with the proposal. I was careful to make sure that none
              of the colors would coincide with the current colors we were using
              for statuses, and that everything had enough contrast to be
              readable.

              We tested several typefaces, but ended up using Avenir Medium for
              body content because of its scalability on the mobile version.
              Avenir Condensed was used for styling our labels.

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              The final product was warmly received by all stakeholders (VP,
              engineering, data modelers, and users). People said that it was
              much easier to use, and that the redesign made the app much more
              "pleasant" to deal with. One data modeler even said that the new
              interface was "Apple-like" and reminded him of his daughter's iPad
              game. The customers ended up using this design as the standard for
              all enterprise level projects in their portfolio.

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              This redesigned application gained a lot of attention from other
              prospects who viewed our case studies. The VP regarded it as a
              shift towards a new paradigm to incorporate more user-centric
              approaches.
