    <h1 class="project-h1">Project Overview</h1>
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">A real estate client wanted solution where they can manage the operations of their facilities. The application would also function as a repository for files and documents pertaining to these facilities. They asked for their website to look more like a dashboard where all the important information is shown at first glance.</p>

     <h1 class="project-h1">Methods</h1>
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
     <p class="project-paragraph">The project kicked off with a meeting with stakeholders and data modelers. We were given an early stage mockup that represented the vision of our clients. After getting the information we needed, I created a more detailed wireframe that would show the flow between screens.</p>
      
       <div class="fortyspace"></div>

      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
            The mockup was refined and reiterated using feedback from our clients at every step. After several revisions, we finally compromised on the UI.

      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
      
        <p class="project-paragraph">
            With the UI design approved by the client team, I went on to building the prototype in DGLux5.
        </p>   
      
       <div class="fortyspace"></div>

      <h1 class="project-h1">The Challenge</h1>
      
       <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        
          The most difficult part of any process is when others don't understand the workflow. The clients had high expectations and didn't know the difference between mockups and prototypes.
          
      </p>
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
        <p class="project-paragraph">The issue was resolved by creating a PDF of screens for them to see and giving our clients access to the DGLux5 prototype. With those assets presented to them, they then understood the design process and our workflow. The also realized that things couldn't be turn over as quickly as they wanted because a lot of factors were involved.</p>

      <h1 class="project-h1">Results</h1>
      
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">
        
          While the process was rocky with some misunderstandings along the way, it brought some good news in the end. The clients loved the final design so much that they wanted to use this UI for all of their properties. This meant that over 30 properties will be integrated by Controlco and use this template.
