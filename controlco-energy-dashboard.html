                  Controlco was tasked to work on one of the largest data
                  centers in the Pacific Northwest. We provided a masters
                  systems integration so that they could maintain desirable
                  conditions within their facility. Data centers need constant
                  monitoring of energy circulation because they host data for
                  many tenants. One of our roadmap items is a dashboard feature
                  that summarizes and tracks the overall energy and health of
                  the facility.

                  To help the users, we needed to design a read-only UI that
                  allows users to track the energy consumption of the data
                  center. A few required data points include the energy and
                  phases of various meters, UPSs, PDUs, as well as data points
                  for Apparent and Real power. My concern was that according to
                  the PM, users absolutely needed to see Apparent and Real
                  power, kVA and kW, at once. The reason for that was because
                  the values are part of some formula that helps them calculate
                  the total power consumed.

                  I was absolutely against the idea of displaying both units of
                  power at once. Showing two power units for every phase of
                  every meter would result in a brutal experience for users as
                  it would make it hard to find data points on the UI and slow
                  the app to crawl. As much as they claimed it would be a "nice
                  to have" in our meetings, I felt that foregoing that option
                  was the user-friendlier choice.

                  Since we didn't have a design guide in place, I took the
                  liberty to come up with a one off. We chose Roboto as it is an

                  We developed the summary page using DGLux5, a rapid
                  development platform made especially for data-driven
                  applications and IoT. We integrated dummy data and allowed our
                  internal data modelers to to test out the performance. After
                  QA'ing it, we granted our users access to the design with
                  their data. The data on the summary loaded quickly, and there
                  was no lag with the toggle either.

                  Users said they appreciated the interactivity of the tables.
                  Hovering over a row would highlight it, allowing them quicker
                  assessment of their units.

                  The feature outperformed old energy summary pages that we had
                  with other facilities. The customer loved the customized
                  toggle and ultimately chose to use this interface as the
                  standard for their other data centers in North America.

                  The summary is very sleek. I also like the little bounce
                  animation you guys put in for the toggle. We work in a really
                  unsexy industry so I appreciate little fun things like this.

                  I was especially honored and delighted that I was able to come
