                  Controlco brings together building systems and networks
                  through a web-based IoT app that lets users control their
                  facility operations. The app consists of data visualizations
                  and HVAC systems where settings can be changed to maintain
                  favorable temperatures and conditions in commercial buildings.
                  Controlco was tasked to work on one of the largest data
                  centers in the Pacific Northwest.

                <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                  Data centers need constant monitoring of energy circulation
                  because they host data for many tenants. In previous versions
                  of our apps for other clients, we provide a dashboard for
                  such. However, the design of our app has changed and we would
                  need an updated energy summary page for this property. This
                  was an opportunity to enhance the energy page based on the
                  users' needs.

                  To help the users, we needed to design a read-only UI that
                  allows users to track the energy consumption of the data
                  center. A few required data points include the energy and
                  phases of various meters, UPSs, PDUs, as well as data points
                  for Apparent and Real power. My concern was that according to
                  the PM, users absolutely needed to see Apparent and Real
                  power, kVA and kW, at once. The reason for that was because
                  the values are part of some formula that helps them calculate
                  the total power consumed.

                  It's important to see the power in both units, but does it
                  really help users to see both at once?

                <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                  I was absolutely against the idea of displaying both units of
                  power at once. Showing two power units for every phase of
                  every meter would result in a brutal experience for users as
                  it would make it hard to find data points on the UI and slow
                  the app to crawl. As much as they claimed it would be a "nice
                  to have" in our meetings, I felt that foregoing that option
                  was the user-friendlier choice.

                <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                  I came up with a proposal that challenged the requirements,
                  which involved:
                </p>
                <ol class="spacebottom">
                  <li>
                    A toggle to switch between kVA and kW to limit the data
                    points that users see so that they can find numbers quickly
                  </li>
                  <li>KPIs</li>
                  <li>Familiar interaction patterns found in tables</li>
                </ol>

                <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                  The reason behind these decisions was to make sure users would

                  Since we didn't have a design guide in place, I took the
                  liberty to come up with a one off. We chose Roboto as it is an
                  easy font to scan within rows of data.

                <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                  We developed the summary page using DGLux5, a rapid
                  development platform made especially for data-driven
                  applications and IoT. We integrated dummy data and allowed our
                  internal data modelers to to test out the performance. After
                  QA'ing it, we granted our users access to the design with
                  their data. The data on the summary loaded quickly, and there
                  was no lag with the toggle either.

                  Users said they appreciated the interactivity of the tables.
                  Hovering over a row would highlight it, allowing them quicker
                  assessment of their units.

                  claimed that it was much easier to read. The customer loved
                  the customized toggle and ultimately chose to use this
                  interface as the standard for their other data centers in
                  North America.

                  The summary is very sleek. I also like the little bounce

                  unsexy industry so I appreciate little fun things like this.

                  I was especially honored and delighted that I was able to come
                  up with this solution which was the direct result of putting
                  our users at the forefront of planning. In some instances like
                  these, customers might claim that they need something because
                  it's something they're used to, but won't be able to give a
                  solid reason as to why it is important to them. As UX
                  designers, it is our resolve to understand our users' end
                  goals and craft the most optimal path for them to get there.
