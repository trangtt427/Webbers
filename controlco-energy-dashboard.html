              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Controlco brings together building systems and networks through
                a web-based IoT app that lets users control their facility
                operations. The app consists of data visualizations and HVAC
                systems where settings can be changed to maintain favorable
                temperatures and conditions in commercial buildings. Controlco
                was tasked to work on one of the largest data centers in the
                Pacific Northwest.

                The problem
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Data centers need constant monitoring of energy circulation
                because they host data for many tenants. In previous versions of
                our apps for other clients, we provide a dashboard for such.
                However, the design of our app has changed and we would need an
                updated energy summary page for this property. This was an
                opportunity to enhance the energy page based on the users'
                needs.

                To help the users, we needed to design a read-only UI that
                allows users to track the energy consumption of the data center.
                A few required data points include the energy and phases of
                various meters, UPSs, PDUs, as well as data points for Apparent
                and Real power. My concern was that according to the PM, users
                absolutely needed to see Apparent and Real power, kVA and kW, at
                once. The reason for that was because the values are part of
                some formula that helps them calculate the total power consumed.

                The Decision To Not Display Both Units

              <div class="thought">
                It's important to see the power in both units, but does it
                really help users to see both at once?
                <div class="tenspace"></div>
                - My inner thoughts
              </div>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                I was absolutely against the idea of displaying both units of
                power at once. Showing two power units for every phase of every
                meter would result in a brutal experience for users as it would
                make it hard to find data points on the UI and slow the app to
                crawl. As much as they claimed it would be a "nice to have" in
                our meetings, I felt that foregoing that option was the
                user-friendlier choice.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                I came up with a proposal that challenged the requirements,
                which involved:
              </p>
              <ol class="spacebottom">
                <li>
                  A toggle to switch between kVA and kW to limit the data points
                  that users see so that they can find numbers quickly
                </li>
                <li>KPIs</li>
                <li>Familiar interaction patterns found in tables</li>
              </ol>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                The reason behind these decisions was to make sure users would
                achieve their goals of
                <strong

                I wireframed the concept of the table for each device. This

                shown to the PM and engineering team, who agreed that the toggle

                Since we didn't have a design guide in place, I took the liberty
                to come up with a one off. We chose Roboto as it is an easy font

                We developed the summary page using DGLux5, a rapid development
                platform made especially for data-driven applications and IoT.
                We integrated dummy data and allowed our internal data modelers
                to to test out the performance. After QA, we granted our users
                access to the design with their data. The data on the summary
                loaded quickly, and there was no lag with the toggle either.

                The feature outperformed old energy summary pages that we had

                claimed that it was much easier to read. The customer loved the
                customized toggle and ultimately chose to use this interface as
                the standard for their other data centers in North America.

                The summary is very sleek. I also like the little bounce

                I was especially honored and delighted that I was able to come
                up with this solution which was the direct result of getting
                users' feedback throughout the process. In some instances like
                these, customers might claim that they need something because
                it's something they're used to, but won't be able to give a
                solid reason as to why it is important to them. As UX designers,
                it is our resolve to understand our users' end goals and craft
                the most optimal path for them to get there.
