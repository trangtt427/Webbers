              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                Incorta is a hyper-converged data analytics platform that removes the
                ETL process in data warehousing and lets users make use of their
                data fast. In the Incorta desktop app, users can provide data in
                two ways: upload CSV/XML files straight into their instance or
                connect to a database. From this information, relationships can be created in order to make dashboard visualizations and tabular reports.
              </p>
              <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop">The Villain of This Story: A Poor File Management System</p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                The current Incorta Data Files page was one of the few remnants of the Angular framework which the platform was built on a few years ago. While it was time to port it over to React, there were other requested features in the roadmap calling for its enhancements. Currently, users couldn't sort and search within files, which are common capabilities you'd expect from a file management system. Users also wanted to be able to create folders to store related data files. I partnered closely with Product Management to work through the user pain points and discover the requirements needed in order to make this a robust data management system.

                        As a power user of the Incorta app, Trisha manages the

                        constantly shares files with other users. Trisha gets
                        frustrated with not being able to categorize her data
                        files. As a result, she is left to look for the files
                        needed each time when she visits the Data tab.
                      </p>

                        folders so that they're easier to to find and share
                        amongst others in her company.

                Some of the Data Analyst's pain points include:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Can't group files for organization</li>
                <li>
                  Difficulty finding files because there is no way to search
                </li>
                <li>
                  The "New" button is confusing because it has different actions
                  depending on which tab you're on and there's no way for users
                  to know that
                </li>
                <li>Want to upload whole folders</li>
              </ol>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                We realized that the
                <strong>Data Analyst's goal is to save time and effort.</strong>
                If they can spend less time searching for files, then they can
                use that time to create joins between tables and rows or connecting to data sources. This solution will
                empower users to customize their environment within Incorta.

              <p class="project-paragraph">
                The PM and I brainstormed ways to translate the requirements into features. On a whiteboard, we listed user
                actions and prioritized them based on how related they are to
                the urgent asks. Here are the tasks we came up with for quick
                wins:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>The ability to create folders and rename folders</li>
                <li>Uploading folders</li>
                <li>Searching and sorting</li>
                <li>Managing permissions to overwrite</li>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                This feature would also require an enhancement in our
                navigation. Now that users will be able to nest folders, they'll
                need a way to traverse through previous folders. We currently
                don't show breadcrumb paths anywhere in our app, so this
                navigation would be an important component.

                The only part of our app that utilizes a (half-baked) directory
                is the Content tab, where dashboards and folders can be grouped
                into folders. However, the current implementation
                doesn't provide a way for users to navigate back to folders in a
                path.

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                We realized the complexity of folders and permissions after
                meeting with the teams. As a result of our discussion, we agreed
                to remove some of the enhancements (moving folders and
                folder-specific permissions) to include them in the later release. For
                the first release, we are only attaching permissions to files
                instead of folders. I updated the wireframes to limit the scope
                of actions and handed it off to Engineering.

                Touching Up the Breadcrumb Again
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                After implementation, we reviewed the feature in our dev
                environment. In a design sync, we eventually agreed that the
                title of the page shouldn't be styled like the breadcrumb path. The
                feedback was that the page title should assume its own identity,
                thus it was decided to move the title of the page to the next
                line. It would also be helpful to users if the page title stayed
                in one spot and not having to jump around depending on how nested the file is.

                After it was QA'd and approved, the feature was rolled out to
                all users. We had positive
                feedback from users, despite not being able to truly treat
                the Data tab like a directory yet. We were told that as a result
                of the feature, it made a huge difference in their data management workflow. They also expressed their excitement for the
                upcoming enhancements in the second phase.

                This support for data files was a long-awaited wish for the
                customers. Moving forward, the breadcrumb design is going to be

                whenever applicable. The next phase for this project is
                currently in the works, which includes folder-specific
                permissions and moving folders around.

                Working on this feature was a reminder that different teams have
                different priorities. While this feature is an important one to
                the users, we were limited by constraints because the engineering
                teams were unable to support everything in the design. It was
                a strategic course of action to give the users what they asked
                for along with easy improvements, followed by bigger
                enhancements in the next release.
