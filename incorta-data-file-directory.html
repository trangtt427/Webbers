              In the Data Tab of Incorta's app, users can provide data in two
              ways: upload CSV/XML files straight into their instance or connect
              to a database. One of the biggest issues that users are facing is
              that they are adding hundreds of data files into a root location,
              without capabilities of creating nested folder structures. Our
              current design lacked any basic directory support of renaming
              files, sharing, and editing.
            </p>

            <p class="caption">
              The old Data Tab had two issues: it has not been migrated to React
              and did not provide a way for users to fully customize their
              environment.

              I led the UX design efforts for this feature. I worked with the
              PM, the engineering team, server team, and collaborated with the
              lead UX designer occasionally for brainstorming and feedback.

              The personas of this app are schema developers. They are a
              technical bunch and are responsible for bringing the data into
              their systems in order to create schemas. Once they build the
              schemas, business users can analyze their data and build
              visualizations.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              I worked with the PMs and a few solutions architects who speak
              directly to these power users to learn about their struggles and
              frustrations. Users have trouble locating their files because
              there's no way to search, although we provide that ability with
              our other pages that have already migrated from Angular to React.

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              Users simply want to save time and effort by having organized

              The ability to support folder structures was a huge ask from a
              customer. The PM wrote up the user story and specified that this
              feature would span across two releases. The first release would
              focus on the basic functions of a directory:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Creating, uploading, and renaming folders</li>
              <li>Sharing files</li>
              <li>Searching</li>
              <li>Breadcrumb navigation</li>
              <li>Managing permissions to overwrite</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              The second release will address folder-specific permissions,
              sharing and moving of folders/files, along with other enhancements
              as needed.

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              The proposal involves redesigning the existing Data Tab to provide
              better support for folder structures and searching. We already
              have list and searchbar components used in the newer React pages
              of our app, so I simply added those to the new design.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              The only part of our app that utilizes a directory is the Content
              Tab, where dashboards can be grouped into folders. However, the
              feature was poorly designed as we don't provide a way for users to
              traverse through folders and back. A breadcrumb navigation was
              important for this feature.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              The problem with our current navigation is that users are unable
              to go back to a previous folder they were in, nor can they see the
              root location. Users would have to click the left caret each time
              if they wanted to go back a step. Our solution to that was to show
              the path leading up to the current location.

              After the implementation, we reviewed it in our test build. We
              weren't too crazy about the title of the page being the last item
              shown in the breadcrumb. After some feedback and brainstorm
              sessions, we decided to separate the title of the page from the
              rest of the breadcrumb path, so that it stays prominent in one
              location. While it seemed minor, this was an important call as we
              would be using this breadcrumb design to replace our half-baked on
              in the Content Tab and for future directories within the app.

              This feature was a huge ask from one of our most engaged

              was a huge time and effort saver. They could now share folders
              containing appropriate files for other users without having to
              manually go search for each and every file. Our customers were
              excited to hear that we were expanding on that design in the
              future release.
