              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                Incorta is a hyper-converged data analytics app that removes the
                ETL process in data warehousing and lets users make use of their
                data fast. In the Incorta desktop app, users can provide data in
                two ways: upload CSV/XML files straight into their instance or
                connect to a database. From this information, tables can be
                joined to create schemas and then ultimately, data
                visualizations.

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                The PM came to us with a huge customer issue: Incorta users are
                adding hundreds of files into a root location without
                capabilities of organizing any of them. The customer ask was
                that we provide a solution that allows actions like so creating
                folders, searching, sorting, and renaming.

                The main user of this feature is the Data Analyst because they
                are the power users responsible for bringing the data into their

                        As a power user of the Incorta app, Trisha manages the
                        data. She connects databases, uploads files, and
                        constantly shares files with other users. Trisha gets
                        frustrated with not being able to categorize her data
                        files. As a result, she is left to look for the files
                        needed each time when she visits the Data tab.
                      </p>

                      <p class="persona-text">
                        Wants personalization. Wants to be able to customize her
                        environment in a way where files are grouped into
                        folders so that they're easier to to find and share
                        amongst others in her company.

                        Very technical and loves being able to customize

                Some of the Data Analyst's pain points include:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Can't group files for organization</li>
                <li>
                  Difficulty finding files because there is no way to search
                </li>
                <li>
                  The "New" button is confusing because it has different actions
                  depending on which tab you're on and there's no way for users
                  to know that
                </li>
                <li>Want to upload whole folders</li>
              </ol>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                We realized that the
                <strong>Data Analyst's goal is to save time and effort.</strong>
                If they can spend less time searching for files, then they can
                use that time to do other productive things. This solution will
                empower users to customize their environment within Incorta.

                The PM and I brainstormed ways to upgrade the Data tab so that
                it answers the user's needs. On a whiteboard, we listed user
                actions and prioritized them based on how related they are to
                the urgent asks. Here are the tasks we came up with for quick
                wins:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>The ability to create folders and rename folders</li>
                <li>Uploading folders</li>
                <li>Searching and sorting</li>
                <li>Managing permissions to overwrite</li>

                  source

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                This feature would also require an enhancement in our
                navigation. Now that users will be able to nest folders, they'll
                need a way to traverse through previous folders. We currently
                don't show breadcrumb paths anywhere in our app, so this
                navigation would be an important component.

                The only part of our app that utilizes a (half-baked) directory
                is the Content tab, where dashboards and folders can be grouped
                into further folders. However, the current implementation
                doesn't provide a way for users to navigate back to folders in a
                path.

                Users couldn't see the previous folder, but also couldn't access
                the root location easily without clicking on the left carets

                internal users about this experience.

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                <strong>Solution:</strong> I designed a breadcrumb component to
                show the root location, an option to look at multiple folders in
                that path, the previous folder, and the current folder that the

                  The server team cannot support the relocating of folders
                  because it was a huge engineering effort and they were slammed
                  with higher priority tasks.

                We realized the complexity of folders and permissions after
                meeting with the teams. As a result of our discussion, we agreed
                to remove some of the enhancements (moving folders and
                folder-specific permissions) to include them in the release. For
                the first release, we are only attaching permissions to files
                instead of folders. I updated the wireframes to limit the scope
                of actions and handed it off to Engineering.

                After implementation, we reviewed the feature in our dev
                environment. In a design sync, we eventually agreed that the
                title of the page shouldn't styled like the breadcrumb path. The
                feeback was that the page title should assume its own identity,
                thus it was decided to move the title of the page to the next
                line. It would also be helpful to users if the page title stayed
                in one spot, for consistency.

                feedback from customers, despite not being able to truly treat
                the Data tab like a directory yet. We were told that as a result
                of the feature, they were able to limit the time spent finding
                and sharing files. They also expressed their excitement for the
                upcoming enhancements in the second phase.

                Working on this feature was a reminder that different teams have
                different priorities. While this feature is an important one to
                the users, we were limited by scope because the engineering
                teams were unable to support everything we had asked for. It was
                a strategic course of action to give the users what they asked
                for along with easy improvements, followed by bigger
                enhancements in the next release.
