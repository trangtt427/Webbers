              In the Incorta app, users can provide data in two ways: upload
              CSV/XML files straight into their instance or connect to a
              database. One of the biggest issues that users are facing is that
              they are adding hundreds of files into a root location, without
              capabilities of organizing any of them. The customer ask was that
              we provide a solution that allows basic directory capabilities
              instead of a flat level.

              I led the UX design efforts for this feature. I worked with a PM,
              the engineering team, the server team, and collaborated with the
              lead UX designer occasionally for brainstorming and feedback.

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              The persona of this feature is the business analyst. They are
              responsible for bringing the data into their systems in order to
              create schemas. Once all the data is there and usable, business
              users can then build visualizations.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              I worked with the PM and a few solutions architects who speak
              directly to these power users to learn about their struggles and
              frustrations. Some of their pain points include:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>No ability to group files into folders</li>
              <li>Difficulty finding files because there's no way to search</li>
              <li>
                The "New" button is confusing because it has different actions
                depending on which tab you're on and there's no way for users to
                know that
              </li>
              <li>Want to upload whole directories</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              We realized that the user's goal is to save time and effort. If
              they can spend less time searching for files, then they can use
              that time to do other productive things within the app. Users have
              expressed their frustration when handling this part of the Incorta
              app. This solution will empower users to able to customize their
              environment in the Incorta app.

              The PM wrote up the user story and specified that this feature
              would span across two releases. The first release would focus on
              these basic functions:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>Creating, uploading, and renaming folders</li>
              <li>Sharing files</li>
              <li>Searching</li>
              <li>Managing permissions to overwrite</li>
              <li>
                Allow "New" button to combine actions for data file and data
                source
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              The second release will address folder-specific permissions and
              how that experience will be for the users.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              This feature would also require an enhancement in our navigation.
              Now that users will be able to nest folders, they'll need a way to
              traverse through previous folders. We currently don't show
              breadcrumb paths anywhere in our app, so this navigation would be
              an important component.

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              The proposal involves redesigning the existing Data tab to provide
              better support for folder structures and searching. At the time, I
              had already started up a design library for Incorta including the
              list and searchbar components. I used these components for the
              Data tab.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              The only part of our app that utilizes a (half-baked) directory is
              the Content tab, where dashboards and folders can be grouped into
              further folders. However, the feature was poorly designed as there
              was no way for users to go back to the folders within a path.

              Users couldn't see the previous folder, but also couldn't access
              the root location easily without clicking on the left carets each
              time. We've had complaints from customers and internal users about
              this scenario. I designed the breadcrumb to show the root
              location, an ellipsis revealing multiple folders, the folder right
              before, and the current folder that the user is in.

              After the implementation, we reviewed it in our test build. We
              didn't really like the idea that the title of the page was styled
              like the breadcrumb path. After some feedback and brainstorm
              sessions, we decided to separate the title of the page from the
              rest of the breadcrumb path, so that it is more obvious to the
              users.

              This feature was a huge ask from multiple customers. After the
              feature was released, users were very pleased with the enhancement
              because it was a huge time and effort saver. They could now share
              folders containing appropriate files and search for files using a
              searchbar. Our customers were excited to hear that we were
              expanding on that design in the next release.
