                <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                    Bio&#8209;Rad is a manufacturer of products for life science research and clinical diagnostics markets. In the past few years, Bio&#8209;Rad began focusing on creating a
                    modern customer experience beyond just desktop. The Global
                    Marcom team channeled their efforts into building a responsive
                    microsite to showcase their top-selling systems from the
                    Clinical Diagnostics Group (CDG) and Life Sciences Group
                    (LSG). They now started caring about implementing actual
                    design and development standards to help their goals.

                <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                    Bio&#8209;Rad has a reputation that precedes them, one that
                    tells of their lack of modern technology. The company does not
                    use the latest and greatest in design and development
                    resources, but that's because they target an audience that
                    doesn't care about those things. I was part of an immature web team where we did not have established code repositories and components for design. We were tasked to create the microsite, maintain its code, distribute it, and supply the marcom department with other web dev/design efforts.

                  I was the main UX designer of the Marcom web team and worked
                  with another hybrid developer/designer. Our responsibilities
                  include taking concepts from start to finish, design and
                  implementation, and maintenance of our code library and
                  documentation. Besides the microsite, I also supported the
                  marketing team by designing and building internal resource
                  tools.

                      We inherited a design system that was still a work in progress.
                      Because about a third of our users browse our material with
                      Internet Explorer, we couldn't use modern browser-supported
                      capabilities like flexbox and grid. Instead, we created a
                      proprietary component library. My team maintained this system and
                      distributed it with the other marcom teams within the department.

                    While the microsite would assume its own brand style, we stayed
                    within the boundaries to make sure that it was easily recognizable
                    with the Bio&#8209;Rad brand. We added more components as well as simpler code into the guide. My team was also involved in educating
                    the other marketing departments to show them how to use our templates. The leading Global Marcom Team
                    adopted our template and are customizing it for their landing pages.

                      We worked closely with multiple project managers who were each in

                      us form the structure of how the microsite would be presented.
                      However, not all countries/regions will have access to every
                      equipment on the website. To support our users, we created two
                      branches for the website; one for the US and one for outside the
                      US (OUS). Although scrappy, a functional gating system was was
                      built from scratch to help redirect users to the right products.
                      This was the optimal experience for users because it would prevent
                      them from seeing products that they cannot purchase.

                              The microsite was launched in early February and received global

                              was a huge milestone as it allowed product managers to finally
                              have a responsive resource to show their customers. It was also a
                              statement to customers to indicate that the company is now pushing
                              towards a better user experience.

                            I felt that one of the biggest struggles we had was trying to help the team break away from the the slow-moving and antiquated processes of Bio&#8209;Rad. At times, it took a lot of effort to defend and explain our design and dev decisions to stakeholders and fellow marcom team members. Luckily, I was able to work within a nimble team and gain support from my manager to pursue what we thought was best for our users.
