            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              In the past few years, Bio&#8209;Rad began focusing on creating a
              customer experience beyond just desktop. The Global Marcom team
              channeled their efforts into building a responsive microsite to
              showcase their top-selling systems from the Clinical Diagnostics
              Group (CDG) and Life Sciences Group (LSG).

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              I was the main UX designer of the Marcom web team and worked with
              another designer who was also a developer. Our responsibilities
              include taking concepts from start to finish, design and
              implementation, and maintenance of our code library and
              documentation. Besides the microsite, I also supported the
              marketing team by designing and building internal resource tools.

              We have two types of users of our projects: customers and the
              internal marketing/sales team. Our customers are scientists and
              clinical diagnostics specialists who are not that tech savvy, and
              tend to use Internet Explorer. They are the main consumers of the
              microsite. The marketing/sales team are also not technical, so all
              of our tools for them are basic.

              While the microsite would assume its own brand style, we stayed
              within the boundaries to make sure that it was easily recognizable
              with the Bio&#8209;Rad brand. My team was involved in educating
              the other marketing departments to show them how to use our
              components and design guide. The leading Global Marcom Team
              adopted our template and are modifying it for company-wide use.

              We worked closely with multiple project managers who each was in
              charge of a product line. Collaborating with them helped us form
              the structure of how the microsite would be presented. However,
              not all countries/regions will have access to every equipment on
              the website. To support our users, we created two branches for the
              website; one for the US and one for outside the US (OUS). Although
              scrappy, a functional proprietary gating system was was built to
              help redirect users to the right products.

              Our code was built locally and then hosted on Marketo where logic
              is linked up to track engagement from users. There are technical
              limitations working within Marketo due to their poor development
              environment. To combat this, our microsite was developed with a
              few hacks to overwrite some of Marketo's baked-in functions.

              The microsite was launched in early February and received global
              praise from within the different departments of the company. This
              was a huge milestone as it allowed product managers to finally
              have a responsive resource to show their customers. It was also a
              statement to customers to indicate that the company is now pushing
              towards better user experiences all of our marketing assets.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              One of the biggest challenges for this project was the slow moving
              process and constant iteration involving several tiers of copy
              approval. The process was improving in the midst of implementation
              but we had buy-in from the upper level of executives to get all
              the resources we needed.
