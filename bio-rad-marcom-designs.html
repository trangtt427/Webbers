                    Bio&#8209;Rad is a manufacturer of products for life science research and clinical diagnostics markets. In the past few years, Bio&#8209;Rad began focusing on creating a
                    modern customer experience beyond just desktop. The Global
                    Marcom team channeled their efforts into building a responsive
                    microsite to showcase their top-selling systems from the
                    Clinical Diagnostics Group (CDG) and Life Sciences Group
                    (LSG).

                <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                    Bio&#8209;Rad is not known to have the latest standards in design and development because it's not their focus. As the company attitudes shifted, they began emphasizing more on user experience. I was part of a small but mighty web team tasked with creating a solutions microsite to showcase all of Bio&#8209;Rad's top-selling products. To do that, we had to first establish design and code guidelines so that we can educate and distribute amongst the other teams within Marcom.

                  I was the main UX designer of the Marcom web team and worked
                  with one other developer. Our responsibilities
                  include designing and building campaign pages and syncing them up with Marketo, and
                   maintaining our design and code documentation. Besides the microsite, I also supported the
                  marketing team by designing and building internal tools. I worked closely with PMs, art directors, and a copywriter.

                      We inherited a design system that was still a work in progress.

                      Internet Explorer, we couldn't use modern browser-supported
                      capabilities like flexbox and grid. Instead, we created a
                      proprietary component library. My team maintained this system and
                      shared the template with the other teams within the department.

                    While the microsite would assume its own brand style, we stayed

                    with the Bio&#8209;Rad brand. We added more components as well as simpler code into the guide. My team was also involved in educating
                    the other marketing departments to show them how to use our templates. The leading Global Marcom Team
                    adopted our template and are customizing it for their landing pages.

                      built from scratch to help redirect users to the right products.
                      This was the optimal experience for users because it would prevent

Luckily, I was able to work within a nimble team and gain support from my manager to pursue what we thought was best for our users.
