                About Incorta
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Incorta is a hyper-converged data analytics app that removes the
                ETL process in data warehousing and lets users make use of their
                data fast. Our app allows users to bring in data to create
                connections between tables, and ultimately, create data
                visualizations so that businesses can make key decisions.
              </p>

              <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                The problem
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                The design lead realized that with our team scaling, we had an issue right in front of our faces: we didn't a place for our design guidelines. Icons,
                fonts, and colors were scattered between dozens of Sketch files
                and Zeplin screens. It was difficult to
                be consistent with our designs, especially between the Egypt
                design team and the front-end engineers. I was tasked with creating a unified Sketch
                library to solve these issues.
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Besides optimizing the workflow amongst designers and engineers,
                the design lead argued that having an Incorta design language
                would help us look more like a mature start-up. One of our design core values of <strong></strong>consistency</strong> implies that using
                a uniform style of components in our app would help users understand the Incorta language. They
                would be able to recognize patterns on different parts of
                the app through repetition, and remember the concepts and interactions associated with them.

                As an early start-up, we didn't feel the need nor have the bandwidth to create icons and common components from scratch. While we were creating new features for the core product, the front-end engineers were also porting the
                entire app into the React framework in parallel.

                We had to keep in mind that the styles used for the Angular pages were going away, and that these new components would have to replace some of our old components in the React pages.

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                We were using the Ant Design Library, a common React UI library. We used the Sketch plug-in to pull icons
                directly into our designs. However, we weren't really
                documenting what icons were being used. It was a pain point
                addressed by engineers to have to go find the components and styles on the Ant Design website. It was also
                especially difficult for them because we were altering some of
                these components to fit within our app without their knowing. Overall, it led to unnecessary hurdles.

              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                My first task was to go through the desktop app to find the
                inconsistencies in our UI. This meant documenting things like
                the different icons being used for similar actions, inconsistent colors,
                misalignment of pixels, incorrect border widths, wrong font sizes,
                etc. I shared my findings with my lead and we wrote up the
                requirements in phases, focusing on the granular bits first
                (color, icon, type) before pursuing the components (buttons and
                patterns). The deliverable would be a master Sketch library that
                would be shared amongst designers.

              <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                Why so many grays?
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Focusing on the colors, I went through the Zeplin styleguide as well as the Incorta app
                to record all the hex values being used. One of our amusing discoveries was that we were using over 15 shades of grays, both cool and warm, without any intention. We accumulated so many variations of one color because some high
                fidelity mock-ups used incorrect hex codes and
                ended up going through development without being questioned.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                After collecting the colors, I met with the design lead to go over which colors we
                should omit. We investigated where certain colors were being
                used and worked up some guidelines on how to use them. Between similar colors, we tested which colors had better web contrast ratios. I created
                a new Sketch file to house the final palette.
              </p>

              Don't we already have an icon for that?
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                While we had no written rules on what type of icons we should be
                using exactly, there was some consistency in the styles that
                appeared in our app as we leaned towards simple icons with
                specific border widths. However, there were several icons being used for the same action. For example, we had three different search icons and several checkmark icons being used for one status. I came up with some proposals on which icons to replace
                and we synced up with figure out how to visually imply their interaction states.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                In some instances, we didn't have Ant icons to represent some Incorta concepts. As a result, I had to find existing icons and redesign them in Illustrator to accommodate our use. I also altered several icons to make them appear as if they came from a family of icons.
              </p>

              <img

                Some of the icons were borrowed from Ant Design while some were original

                Next, all the fonts were extracted from the app and Zeplin
                projects. As we were creating new features, new styles were
                needed to support heavy displays of data. I confirmed with the
                lead to see where our fonts were being used and how, and added it to the
                Sketch library. I had written out guidelines where to use
                certain styles.

                The last phase of the design library were the components. I
                collected the UI patterns on our app which were modified Ant
                Design components and created Sketch symbols using our updated
                colors, fonts, and icons. They were categorized by their usage,
                whether they were navigation-specific symbols, table components,
                or used globally.

                that it was nice to have all of our assets in one place, and if
                the engineers had any questions on what icons to use, they'd
                have a place to refer back to. The icons were all made to be

                I designed the symbols in a way where they can be easily customized and have certain values overridden. The components are
                entirely flexible and the master file was being maintained and
                updated every day and shared through our Google Drive. Although it wasn't considered a completed library, it was helpful to many people.

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                The design system helped us in having a single
                source of truth when it came to controlling consistency within
                the Incorta product. It was important when multiple
                designers were working on the core app and had to use global
                patterns. We were no longer opening separate Sketch files to find out how something was designed, where to find an icon, or what color to use. Having the design system readily available as a Sketch
                library helped us work efficiently as we were able to pull the
                assets directly into our prototypes. Even though I was working
                on features, I was still updating the library whenever we
                ended up creating new patterns.

              />
              <p class="caption spacebottom">Voila! The updated Incorta Design Library.</p>

                The takeaway: thoughts and lessons
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Creating this system took about a month. Before diving in, I spent time
                researching dozens of design systems and reading into best
                practices on how to deliver one. The oppportunity to come up
                with a design system for Incorta was an important milestone for
                the design team, as we were now ramping up our processes and
                scaling the team.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Unfortunately, I didn't get to revisit the design system as much
                as I would have liked because there were some internal concerns with the design team and the allocation of our efforts. The design lead advocated
                for having a mature design system, but we had to be scrappy at a
                start-up, meaning we had to focus on customer-facing
                features first. To me, a company that spent time and resources into
                a library tells me that the company cares about
                design. Things that I would have liked to do would include
                expanding the design system further to consolidate the Dark Mode
                UI that I created earlier as well as work with a technical writer to incorporate a unified tone and voice in our app.
