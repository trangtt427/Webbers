                About Incorta
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Incorta is a hyper-converged data analytics app that removes the
                ETL process in data warehousing and lets users make use of their
                data fast. Our app allows users to bring in data to create
                connections between tables, and ultimately, create data
                visualizations so that businesses can make key decisions.
              </p>

              <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                The Problem
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                In my first few days of starting Incorta, I immediately learned
                that we didn't have easy access to our design components. Icons,
                fonts, and colors were scattered between dozens of Sketch files
                and Zeplin screens. As a result of this, it made it difficult to
                be consistent with our designs, especially between the Egypt
                design team and the front-end engineers. My lead knew about such
                pain points before I came onboard. Since I had experience with
                design systems, my lead tasked me with creating a unified Sketch
                library to solve these issues.
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Besides optimizing the workflow amongst designers and engineers,
                the design lead argued that having an Incorta design language
                would help us look like a more "mature" company. Also by
                focusing on one of our design core values of <strong></strong>consistency</strong>, having
                a certain style of components appear globally on our
                app would help users understand the Incorta language. Users
                would be able to recognize such patterns on different parts of
                the app through repetition, and remember the interactions associated with them.

                As an early start-up, we didn't have the bandwidth to create a

                for the core product, the front-end engineers were also porting the
                entire app into the React framework in parallel.

                We were using the Ant Library Sketch plug-in to pull icons
                directly into our Sketch files. However, we weren't really
                documenting what icons were being used. It was a pain point
                addressed by engineers to have to go find the components and styles on the Ant Library website. It was also
                especially difficult for them because we were altering some of
                these components to fit within our app without their knowing. Overall, it was just poor design etiquette.

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                The first thing I did was go through the desktop app to find the
                inconsistencies in our app. This meant documenting things like
                the different icons being used for similar actions, inconsistent colors,
                misalignment of pixels, incorrect border widths, wrong fonts,
                etc. I shared my findings with my lead and wrote up the
                requirements in phases, focusing on the granular bits first
                (color, icon, type) before pursuing the components (buttons and
                patterns). The deliverable would be a master Sketch library that
                would be shared amongst designers.
              </p>

              <p class="pre-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
                Colors
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                I went through the Zeplin styleguide as well as the Incorta app
                to collect all the colors we were using. We had colors that were
                fairly similar to one another because there was no color palette
                handed off to Engineering along with wireframes. Some high
                fidelity mock-ups used different hex codes unintentionally which
                ended up going through development without considering the
                existing color palette.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                After collecting the colors and testing their contrast ratios on
                web, I met with the design lead to go over which colors we
                should omit. We investigated where certain colors were being
                used and worked up some guidelines on how to use them. I created
                a new Sketch file to house the final palette.

                Icons
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                While we had no written rules on what type of icons we should be
                using, there was some consistency in the type of icons that
                appeared in our app as we leaned towards simple icons with
                specific border widths. The Ant Design library, however, had
                multiple styles for the same icons, and we were using several of
                them. I came up with some proposals on which icons to replace
                and we synced up with figure out the different states of icons
                (default, hover, focused, etc.).
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                In a Sketch file, I had grouped icons with similar actions next
                to each other. It was a simple process of going through the
                icons and simply picking out which ones we didn't want to use,
                as they didn't sit well with our current suite of icons.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                In some instances, we didn't have Ant Library icons of some concepts. As a result, I had to find existing icons and redesign them in Illustrator for our use. I also altered several icons to make them appear as if they came from a family of icons.

                Next, all the fonts were consolidated from the app and Zeplin
                projects. As we were creating new features, some new styles were
                needed to support heavy displays of data. I confirmed with the
                lead what font sizes were being used where, and added it to the
                Sketch library. I had written out guidelines where to use
                certain styles.

                the same class. We received feedback from the front-end team
                that it was nice to have all of our assets in one place, and if
                the engineers had any questions on what icons to use, they'd
                have a place to refer back to. The icons were all made to be
                exportable in the Zeplin screens as well.

                was getting ready to scale and we didn't have a mature process
                of collaborating designer to designer. The Sketch library I
                created was a good starting point, because my lead and I were
                heavily using it to create both lo-fi and high-fi mock-ups
                quickly.

                I carefully crafted the symbols so that designers using the
                system can easily override certain assets. The components are
                entirely flexible and the master file was being maintained and
                updated every day and shared through our Google Drive.

                Where the Incorta Design Library Stands Today

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                After the design system was completed enough to be used,
                priorities changed and I was delegated other features to work
                on. However, the design system helped us in having a single
                source of truth when it came to controlling consistency within
                the Incorta product. It was especially important when multiple
                designers were working on the core app and had to use global
                patterns. Having the design system readily available as a Sketch
                library helped us work efficiently as we were able to pull the
                assets directly into our prototypes. Even though I was working
                on other projects, I was still updating the library whenever we
                ended up creating new patterns.

                The Takeaway
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                The project took about a month. I spent a lot of time
                researching dozens of design systems and reading into best
                practices on how to deliver one. The oppportunity to come up
                with a design system for Incorta was an important milestone for
                the design team, as we were now ramping up our processes and
                scaling the team.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Unfortunately, I didn't get to revisit the design system as much
                as I would like because upper management was concerned about
                where we were allocating our efforts. As designers, we advocated
                for having a mature design system, but we had to be scrappy at a
                start-up, meaning they wanted us to focus on customer-facing
                features. To me, a company that allocates resources into
                maintaining a library tells me that the company cares about
                design. Things that I would have liked to do would include
                expanding the design system further to consolidate the Dark Mode
                UI that I created earlier as well as work with a technical writer to incorporate a unified voice in our messaging.
