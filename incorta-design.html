              With the promise of delivering a Dark Mode for the next release,
              it was important to first nail down our design system. This would
              solve the issue of not having a single source of truth for shared
              assets between teams. I was tasked with creating a living design
              library to unify all of our assets, while coming up with a fully
              accessible dark theme for our platform. The results amazed
              prospects and current users in feature demos, which contributed to
              successful closing of contracts.

          An Incorta Dark Mode was a roadmap item for the next release.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          One of our longest tenured customers requested a dark version of the
          Incorta platform. We learned that they were interested in the feature
          for a very specific reason: the visualizations were a bit hard to see
          when presenting them in meetings with other key business members. A
          few of their users also expressed interest in a dark mode because
          their system preferences are set to a dark mode, so most of their apps
          followed suit. Having to switch over to the light UI of Incorta was a
          bit jarring to their eyes.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Product felt that it was an easy task to deliver but the issue at the
          time was that we hadn't yet codified a design system. Without one, it
          would be difficult to even begin thinking about a dark equivalent.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="project-row anim appear">
        <img src="images/incorta-design-library/antlib2.png" />
        <p class="caption">
          We used the Ant Design as building blocks for our components. We also
          had to alter some of the assets to align with Incorta-specific
          concepts and use cases.

          "Hey, where can I find the right [insert component here]?"
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          In order to start working on an Incorta Dark Mode, we needed to first
          put together a design system. This was appropriately timed because we
          currently had problems that threatened the way designers and engineers
          collaborated: no alignment on where to store all of our design assets.
          Icons, fonts, and colors were scattered between Ant Design components,
          dozens of Sketch files and people's local desktops. There were a few
          issues with this:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Engineers were not being informed of where to find certain assets,
            so they were implementing things outside of our Incorta colors and
            icons.
          </li>
          <li>
            The codebase became convoluted because we had too many variances of
            certain colors. It was easy to get colors and text styles mixed up.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designers were spending more time than necessary to create
            wireframes because we didn't have a master component library.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          By finally cleaning up our design system and creating a symbol
          library, I'd be able to craft a dark theme for users while making
          processes efficient for both designers and engineers.

          in Illustrator to accommodate our use. I also altered several icons to
          make them appear as if they came from a family of icons.

          usage, whether they were navigation-specific symbols, table
