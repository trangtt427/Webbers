              The Incorta Data Analytics Platform is used by hundreds of
              companies, including some big Fortune 500 names to resolve their
              most complex data analytics challenges. Data analysts had a
              longstanding issue with managing their data. There were major
              limitations that made it hard to organize and find data files. For
              the upcoming release, I introduced a solution that treated the
              Incorta Data File tab as a directory, resulting in a significantly
              improved workflow for data analysts.

          The Villain of this Story: A Poor File Management System
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Incorta is a data analytics software that aggregates large complex
          business data in real time, eliminating the need to reshape it via
          data warehousing. Users have long complained about Incorta's lack of
          support for data file management. Data files were limited to one
          upload at a time, there was no concept of file locations, and a
          built-in search function was nowhere to be seen. Additionally, the
          current Data Files page was one of the few remnants of the outdated
          Angular framework. It was a roadmap item for Engineering to port the
          page over to React.

          As the lead designer for this project, I started off identifying areas

          workstream.

          and work with it in more depth so that they can create visualizations
          to be consumed by others. But in order to do that, data needs to be

          The proposed designs aligned with the requirements, but were met with

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          In a sync with the Server and Front-end teams, we learned that they
          couldn't commit to some of our asks. They had already allocated
          resources to some of the higher priority backend projects. Some of the
          things they couldn't accommodate in this sprint include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Functionality to move folders</li>
          <li>Merging the upload folders and files actions into one prompt</li>
          <li>Folder-level permissions</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          As a result of our discussion, we agreed to move some of the
          enhancements to a V2. I updated the wireframes to limit the scope of
          actions and handed it off to Engineering.

          The Data File enhancements were delivered in the Incorta 4.6 release
          (check out the

          that there was a sizable difference in the experience of their
          workflow. They were able to finally edit all files right inside the
          Incorta app, share top-level folders with peers, and cut down time by
          a lot. They also appreciated that the Data Files page was finally
          redesigned to be consistent with the rest of the platform.

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Another achievement from this was that the breadcrumb design is going
          to be standard implementation. The next phase for this project is
          currently in the works, which includes folder-specific permissions and
          moving folders around.
