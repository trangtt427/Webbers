          The Villain of this Story: A Poor File Management System

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          The current Incorta Data Files page was one of the few remnants of the
          outdated Angular framework which the platform was built on a few years
          ago. One of the outstanding company roadmap items was to port the Data
          Files page over to React, but enhancing the data functionalities was
          the more anticipated feature for users.
        </p>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Users have long complained about the lack of support for data file
          management in the Incorta platform. Files could only be uploaded in a
          flat location, with no grouping or customization. There was also no
          bulk upload concept. Users wanted to spend less time
          managing/finding/uploading files so they can proceed with their other
          functions within Incorta.

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          I realized if we introduced the concept of folders in this
          enhancement, we would be allowing users to nest folders inside one
          another. Users will need a way to traverse through the file path. The
          only part of our app that utilizes somewhat of a directory structure
          is the Content tab, where dashboards and folders can be grouped into
          folders. Users complained about our current implementation of the
          breadcrumb in the Content tab because it didn't provide a way for them
          to navigate back to folders in a path. Users wanted the transparency
          of knowing their location in the hierarchical structure so they can
          browse back to higher levels.

          Users had a few workarounds for some of these challenges.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          To ensure that relevant files are clumped together in the listing
          page, users adhered to a naming convention before uploading. For
          example, files that were used together were named in alphanumeric
          order. It helped greatly for them, but it was extra work upfront.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          There was no concept of pagination on this page and because everything
          was loading at once, it would take over five seconds for all data to
          appear. Users resorted to Ctrl+F to find what they're looking for, but
          this would be a challenge for users who can't recall the exact name of
          these files.

          I looked at a few industry leaders to get an idea on how each of them
          handled file storage and navigation. Google Drive, Onedrive, Dropbox,
          and Egnyte were a few that I drew ideas from. I created wireframes to
          communicate what the new file structure and functionalities would look
          like. The new breadcrumb component would show the root location, an
          option to look at multiple filders in that path, the previous folder,
          and the current level that the user is in. This would solve the issue
          of users not knowing their location in the hiearchical structure.

          The proposed designs aligned with the requirements, but we were met
          with engineering constraints.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          In a sync with the Server and Front-end teams, we learned that they
          couldn't accommodate some of the solutions. They had already allocated
          resources to some of the higher priority backend projects. Some of the
          things they couldn't deliver in time include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Functionality to move folders because there was not enough time to
            do any engineering spikes to figure out technical deficits
          </li>
          <li>
            Merging the upload folders and files actions into one prompt because
            the current endpoints don't support that
          </li>
          <li>Folder-level permissions</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="eyebrow">
          "What if a user doesn't have permission to a certain folder, but has
          access to the file within it?"
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          We realized the complexity of folders and permissions. There wasn't
          enough investigation around the edge cases. As a result of our
          discussion, we agreed to move some of the enhancements to a V2. For
          the first release, we are only attaching permissions to files instead
          of folders. I updated the wireframes to limit the scope of actions and
          handed it off to Engineering.

          Small Feature Enhancements, Huge Increase in Productivity
        </p>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          The Data File enhancements were delivered in the Incorta 4.6 release
          (check out the
          <a
            href="https://docs.incorta.com/4.6/rns/"

            target="_blank"
            >release notes</a
          >). After the launch, PMs evaluated the enhancements when meeting with
          customers. Users shared positive feedback, saying that there was a
          sizable difference in the experience of their workflow. They were able
          to share top-level folders with peers and cut down time by a lot. They
          also appreciated that the Data Files page was finally redesigned to
          match the rest of the platform. Finally, they also expressed their
          excitement for the upcoming enhancements in the second phase.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Another achievement from this was that the breadcrumb design is going
          to be the standard implementation. The next phase for this project is
          currently in the works, which includes folder-specific permissions and
          moving folders around.
