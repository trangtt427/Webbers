          The Villain of this Story: A Poor File Management System
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Incorta is a data analytics software that aggregates large complex
          business data in real time, eliminating the need to reshape it via
          data warehousing. Users have long complained about Incorta's lack of
          support for data file management. Data files were limited to one
          upload at a time, there was no concept of file locations, and a
          built-in search function was nowhere to be seen. Additionally, the
          current Data Files page was one of the few remnants of the outdated
          Angular framework (everything else on our platform was using React).

          In a sync with the Server and Front-end teams, we learned that they
          couldn't commit to some of our asks. They allocated resources to some
          of the higher priority backend projects. Some of the things they
          couldn't accommodate in the next two sprints include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Functionality to move folders</li>
          <li>Merging the upload folders and files actions into one prompt</li>

          As a result of our discussion, we agreed to move some of the

          Engineering.

          Small Feature Enhancements, Big Increase in Productivity

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          After about two months, the Data File enhancements were shipped in the
          Incorta 4.6 release (check out the
          <a

            >release notes</a
          >). Usually, users don't upgrade right away to the newest Incorta
          platform as it does take an extra bit of effort and overhead. But
          users were willing to switch to Incorta 4.6 just for the data file
          enhancements. Users noticed a sizable improvement in their workflow.
          They were able to finally edit files right inside the Incorta app,
          share folders with peers, and cut down time by a lot. Users didn't
          mind that they couldn't move files and folders around in this version,
          as they were satisfied with this set of enhancements for the time
          being. Users were pleased to know that we were continuing to improve
          the directory feature in the next release.
