          Incorta users have long complained about the product limitations around data support. There were several things missing to help them manage their data, such as organizing files into folders, editing files, and searching. Users couldn't tailor their Incorta environment to their liking.

          The current Data page was one of the last pieces that needed to be ported over from Angular to React. The duality of this opportunity meant tackling an engineering initiative and a highly requested user ask in parallel.

          For this project, we were servicing the data
          analysts (known internally as the "power users"). These users leverage
          advanced analytical tools to dive into their data, working to create visualizations for their stakeholders. Before any of that happens, data first needs to be brought into their Incorta instance through one of two ways. The first way is by connecting the platform to a database and second, is by uploading data files. Going with the former meant users would have to do some extra upfront work if they're looking to customize their data.

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          We learned that our Front End and Server teams
          couldn't commit to some of the asks because resources have been allocated to higher priority projects. The few things they
          couldn't accommodate in the next two sprints included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Functionality to move folders</li>
          <li>Merging the upload folders and files actions into one prompt</li>
          <li>Folder-level permissions</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
         

          The current library couldn't support the first two features and would require a lot of engineering work to make that happen. The Folder-level permissions also opened a can of worms. We failed to realized its complexities and all the possible scenarios. We decided to move these out of our MVP so that we can prioritize getting the other features delivered on time and buy us more time to carefully think through the permissions.
