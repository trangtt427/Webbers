            the outdated Angular framework which the platform was built on a few
            years ago. One of the outstanding company roadmap items was to port
            the Data Files page over to React, but enhancing this part of the
            platform was also a long-awaited user request.

            Users have complained about the lack of support for data file

            From there, relationships are mapped from these data objects to

            There are two ways of bringing data into Incorta. First is by
            connecting to a database, and second, is through uploading CSV or
            Excel files. However, if users decided to go with the file route,
            there was no concept of folders to organize the files to their
            liking. This was one of several issues that users had with the app.

            To ensure that relevant files are clumped together in the listing

            order. It was extra work upfront, but it allowed files to be easier

            In addition to what users said they wanted, I did some research on a
            few industry leaders to get an idea on how each of them handled
            storage. I looked to Google Drive, Dropbox, and Egnyte to name a
            few. I created wireframes to communicate what the new file structure
            and functionalities would look like.

            Introducing the concept of folders would mean nesting. Now that
            users will be able to nest folders, they'll need a way to traverse
            through the file path. The only part of our app that utilizes
            somewhat of a directory structure is the Content tab, where
            dashboards and folders can be grouped into folders. However, the
            current implementation doesn't provide a way for users to navigate
            back to folders in a path.

            The Product Team aligned with the proposed designs, until we were
            met with engineering constraints.

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            In a sync with the server and front-end teams, we found out that
            some of our tasks would not be able to fit in the upcoming release.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The server team cannot support the relocating of folders because
              it was a huge engineering effort and they were slammed with higher
              priority tasks.
            </li>
            <li>
              The front-end team is unable to merge the upload folders and files
              into one prompt (their current tech stack doesn't support that).
            </li>
            <li>The server team cannot support folder-specific permissions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="eyebrow">
            "What if a user doesn't have permission to a certain folder, but has
            access to the file within it?"
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            We realized the complexity of folders and permissions after meeting
            with the teams. As a result of our discussion, we agreed to remove
            some of the enhancements (moving folders and folder-specific
            permissions) to include them in the later release. For the first
            release, we are only attaching permissions to files instead of
            folders. I updated the wireframes to limit the scope of actions and
            handed it off to Engineering.

            We had positive feedback from users, despite not being able to truly
            treat the Data tab like a directory yet. We were told that as a
            result of the feature, it made a huge difference in their data
            management workflow. They also expressed their excitement for the
            upcoming enhancements in the second phase.

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            This support for data files was a long-awaited wish for the
            customers. Moving forward, the breadcrumb design is going to be the
            standard implementation for the other pages in Incorta whenever
            applicable. The next phase for this project is currently in the
            works, which includes folder-specific permissions and moving folders
            around.

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            Working on this feature was a reminder that it's not uncommon that
            teams are not aligned on priorities. While this feature was an
            important one to the users, we were constrained by limited
            resources. In hindsight, things may have been more efficient had
            Engineering been a part of our early alignment meetings or kickoff
            to help identify what was possible and what wasn't.
