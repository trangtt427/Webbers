              The Incorta software allows for realtime data analytics without needing any transformation or data warehousing. Unfortunately, the data analysts using Incorta were dealing with lackluster data file
              support which made their job more grueling than it needed to be. I led the design of several features to help users better manage
              their data files and sources so that they can focus on their actual job: uncovering important business insights. The results were increased productivity for users and a high number of customers upgraded to the latest version of Incorta.

          The Villain of this Story: A Poor File Management System

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Users have long complained about Incorta's lack of
          support for data file management. There was no concept of a folder directory, data files could only be uploaded one at a time (and couldn't be edited once brought in), and
          finding files was a nightmare (no native searching functionality). A workflow for users to tailor their Incorta environment was missing entirely.

          Folders and file directory support were already implemented in the new React parts of the software, but users still had trouble traversing through folder levels. This was due to our poorly built navigation patterns. Users griped about our

          The proposed designs satisfied user goals, but we were met with
      resourcing constraints.

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          In a sync with the Server and Front-end teams, we learned that they
          couldn't commit to some of our asks. Resources have been allocated to some
          of the higher priority backend projects. Some of the things they
          couldn't accommodate in the next two sprints included:

        <ul>
          <li>Functionality to move folders</li>
          <li>Merging the upload folders and files actions into one prompt</li>
          <li>Folder-level permissions</li>
        </ul>

          We agreed on moving these proposals out of our MVP to future releases so that we can prioritize getting this delivered on time.

          After about two months, the Data File enhancements were shipped in the
          Incorta 4.6 release (check out the

          Incorta platform as it does take a bit of work. But they were
          willing to switch to Incorta 4.6 after hearing that Data File upgrades were a part of the package.
          After the release, we received feedback from users about how they can finally cut down some time around maintaining their data.
