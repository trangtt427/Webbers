        <h2>In 2025, Airbnb reached out to the Acuity Scheduling team with a partnership opportunity.
        </h2>
        <p>In what was described as their biggest release of the summer, Airbnb would integrate with Acuity Scheduling (Squarespace's booking platform) so that users in verticals like photography, beauty, and food can offer their services on Airbnb's vetted marketplace. Acuity would get commission from those Airbnb bookings.

      <section class="case-study-body">
        <h2>I was tasked to lead the design of the full user journey of this integration.</h2>
        <p>I shaped the entire experience, from feature discovery to post-connection empty and populated states, edit appointment type, and calendar booking view. Aside from working closely with Product and Engineering on the Acuity side, I collaborated with the Airbnb product development team to move in lockstep and make sure our systems were in sync.

        <div class="case-study-two-col-text">
          <p>We had to first identify the exact vertical eligibility criteria for the integration and make sure that the right users were able to see the integration. This includes other requirements as well—the user can't be an Enterprise customer, doesn't need HIPAA compliance,must be on a paid Acuity subscription, and is the sole admin.</p>

        <h2>The build was highly complex, with many dependencies on Airbnb.</h2>
        <p>A lot of deep technical work was required to make calendars and availabilities sync across both platforms. Airbnb had strict requirements related to activity durations, so we had to create validations and enforce certain rules in Acuity. Although it would be incredibly rare, I still thought in terms of extreme edge cases such as previously eligible admins becoming HIPAA-compliant.</p>

        <h2>Acuity offerings went live on Airbnb's marketplace a few months after their app relaunch.</h2>
        <p>Airbnb created strong marketing buzz around the release. We launched to a small cohort first to catch bugs, then ramped to 100%. This was a major milestone for our business; it was the first time we built functionality to expose our services on third-party platforms. After the release, Acuity took these learnings to expand on distribution, looking for other opportunities to apply the same patterns of cross-listing. By the end of 2025, we had more than 4,000 users connect to Airbnb.</p>
