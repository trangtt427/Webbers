              <h4 class="mb-4">A Baby is Born</h4>
              <p>A design system is a collection of a company's reusable components and guidelines that tells designers what, how, and when to use certain patterns. Instead of reinventing the wheel each time a new feature comes along, designers can use what's already been validated and established, ensuring quality and consistency across the different products offered by the company. This also saves internal teams a whole lot of time when building. At one company, we had a design system in place that was used to develop one of our products, but once multiple designers started leveraging it for their respective projects, we soon learned that the system was limited when designing at scale.</p>

            </div>

          <div class="container pt-3">
            <div class="line-width">
                <p class="">I spent a lot of time hunting for components in this system and trying to make sense of what I was allowed to use. I was curious about the thought process that led to the components being constructed and organized in the way that they were and thought about what I would have done differently. This inspired me. I wanted to try my hand at creating a personal design system from scratch; one that is equipped with the essentials, clearly documented, and easy to customize. For a month, I dedicated a dozen hours a week towards this new design system&mdash;which I lovingly named "Baby Design System".

                  <h4 class="mb-4">Flexible Components For All Your Needs</h4>
                  <p>The design system at my company was overloaded with redundancy; similar but  separate components existed for their different styles. If I had a small button component in front of me but wanted to use a larger size, I'd naturally look to see if there were any variants. If not, I would search and see if that option was even available. I sought to avoid this in Baby Design System. I wanted to offer more visibility into what permutations exist through a single master component and make it easy to swap between them. Don't like rectangle buttons? Toggle to round buttons. Want to change the primary color of your button? Change it upstream to the color of your choice and watch it proliferate for all buttons. With just a single component, users have the controls for all of its attributes in one place.</p>

                  <p>My experience with my company's design system compelled me to take design documentation seriously. It wasn't immediately clear to me if I was looking at a master component or one of its instances. I was bouncing around the Figma file trying to locate guidelines and what options were available to me. With Baby Design System, I've organized everything in a way where users can instantly see what the different customizations are. Also included are anchors to help users jump to the master components. My documentation took a page from Ant Design, a popular enterprise-grade design system that I've enjoyed and used extensively in the past. Another helpful tool for documentation was a plugin called Foundation: Color Generator, which I used to assemble some neat color palettes that show the contrast ratios for each color.</p>

                <p>Nothing I've done here is groundbreaking; it's the typical process one would go through to create a design system. Getting hands on with building Baby Design System was still a rewarding experience though. Is it a comprehensive system? Not at all! There are plenty of free design systems out there that are far more mature with thousands of variants. But if you're someone who wants to focus on prototyping instead of building custom components and needs just the basics&mdash;buttons, forms, alerts, tabs, even tables&mdash;this design system will have you covered.

                  <p class="">Creating (and even using) a design system properly requires a lot of discipline and planning, just like building a real product for people to use. Through this endeavor, I've learned what it takes to craft components down to their pixel-perfect details, when not to create variants, and to consider accessibility frequently. And for the first time, I got to design for an interesting type of user; the designer who swears by Figma. What started off as a personal experiment is now a living, breathing, and growing passion project. I'm still adding more to Baby Design System, including handmade icons and illustrations at some point. Coming soon to Figma Community!

                  <p>I support several internal teams through service design. Many of the early initiatives were around closing business gaps of having moved away from a third-party recordkeeper. One service I helped ship was a deconversion tool to help our internal teams liquidate assets for plans that want to move to a different 401(k) provider. The benefits of having a third-party recordkeeper meant that they took care of the plan transitioning, so we never had the functionalities or the workflow for this. It was nearing the end of the year, and plans who've reached out a few times to deconvert were growing restless and impatient with our inability to take care of the deconversion.</p>

                  <p class="">I partnered with Product, Deconversion Specialists and the Director of Retirement Administration to map out the major players and actions needed for this process. We worked out things like:</p>
                  <ul><li>Standardizing the Letter of Intent (the official letter a plan gives us to let us know that they want out) and which team is responsible for getting this signed and communicated to the recordkeeping team</li>

                  <p>One of the most challenging projects was a multiyear effort in unifying all of our disparate systems into one user-friendly operations management tool. Workflows and customer information were split across different systems, each with their own set of permissions and were built without the users in mind. Internal and Support team workstreams were wildly inefficient as tickets had to be opened in order to get the right information to the right people. We were in the middle of a massive rearchitecting of our services, so we had support from Leadership to finally tackle this longstanding challenge.</p>

                  <p>As the only designer hired to work on the product, I brought some common design tools (the Sketch-InVision-Zeplin trifecta) and frameworks into the mix to improve the process between all parties. I worked with a project manager and an engineer, partnering especially close with the former to standardize regular calls with our customers. Design eventually became an important stakeholder in these meetings, which opened the floodgates for interviewing users, workshopping sessions, and clearer requirements for Engineering. The CEO started stepping back from the waterfall way of doing things when it became clear that the new approach led to quality, user-approved solutions faster, and with less Engineering throw-away work. </p>
