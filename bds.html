              <p>A design system is a collection of reusable UI elements and patterns, accompanied by guidelines on how they should be used. Instead of reinventing the wheel each time a new feature comes along, product teams use design systems to create consistent experiences faster without compromising quality.</p>

                <p class="">A company I worked for built a design system as part of a massive redesign, but as soon as multiple designers started working out of it, we learned that it wasn't as efficient as we thought when designing at scale. We ended up rebuilding some of the components as <a

                  <p class=""> I was compelled to explore this realm a bit more. I wanted to try my hand at creating my own design system from scratch; one that would help people design faster, is neatly organized, and has straightforward customizations. For a month, I dedicated a dozen hours a week towards this personal design system&mdash;which I lovingly dubbed <i>Baby Design System.</i>

                  <p>My company's design system had multiple components for various states. For example, we had two different button components for size; one small and one big. Some components were made with extra layers so that we could hack different variations. I solved this in Baby Design System with variants and built in as many customizable properties as possible per component. My goal was to limit the components users had to think about and give them full control of the styles of those components.</p>

                  <p class="">I applied the same principle to complex components such as tables.

Row items can be swapped between text, actions, statuses, and avatars.

                  <p>Dabbling in the company's design system was a learning experience and reinforced the importance of detailed guidelines. Sometimes I'd stumble across a component that I should have used instead of the one I implemented. Other times, I'd be using the right component, but would have to fiddle with the layers to get the to the permutation I wanted. Having these things spelled would have saved me time, so when it was my turn to do this for Baby Design System, I documented all possible levels of customization offered. Colors, typography, icons, components and variants&mdash;everything was well-organized, in plain view, and had accompanying notes.</p>

                <p>Nothing I've done here is groundbreaking, as this is typically how a design system comes to life in Figma. Is it a comprehensive system? Depends on what <i>you</i> need. There are lots of free design systems out there that are loaded with hundreds of components and styles. But if you want to design quickly and need just the basics&mdash;buttons, forms, alerts, tabs, even tables&mdash;then this design system is for you!

                  <p class="mb-5">Creating (and even using) a design system properly requires discipline and planning. And as gratifying as this was, I think that any decision to create a design system at a company should be considered carefully. It may not be cost-efficient for a young company to go all in on their own design system as one of their first pursuits. Using one of the many popular established design systems tends to be the smarter choice for development velocity. What's more important than knowing how to create a design system is knowing <i>how to use one</i> and understanding the concept of building for modularity and repeatability. I'm still adding lots more to Baby Design System and hope to even create my own illustrations at some point. Check it out through the link below!

                  <p>I support several internal teams through service design. Many of the early initiatives were around closing business gaps of having moved away from a third-party recordkeeper. One service I helped ship was a deconversion tool to help our internal teams liquidate assets for plans that want to move to a different 401(k) provider. The benefits of having a third-party recordkeeper meant that they took care of the plan transitioning, so we never had the functionalities or the workflow for this. It was nearing the end of the year, and plans who've reached out a few times to deconvert were growing restless and impatient with our inability to take care of the deconversion.</p>

                  <p class="">I partnered with Product, Deconversion Specialists and the Director of Retirement Administration to map out the major players and actions needed for this process. We worked out things like:</p>
                  <ul><li>Standardizing the Letter of Intent (the official letter a plan gives us to let us know that they want out) and which team is responsible for getting this signed and communicated to the recordkeeping team</li>

                  <p>One of the most challenging projects was a multiyear effort in unifying all of our disparate systems into one user-friendly operations management tool. Workflows and customer information were split across different systems, each with their own set of permissions and were built without the users in mind. Internal and Support team workstreams were wildly inefficient as tickets had to be opened in order to get the right information to the right people. We were in the middle of a massive rearchitecting of our services, so we had support from Leadership to finally tackle this longstanding challenge.</p>

                  <p>As the only designer hired to work on the product, I brought some common design tools (the Sketch-InVision-Zeplin trifecta) and frameworks into the mix to improve the process between all parties. I worked with a project manager and an engineer, partnering especially close with the former to standardize regular calls with our customers. Design eventually became an important stakeholder in these meetings, which opened the floodgates for interviewing users, workshopping sessions, and clearer requirements for Engineering. The CEO started stepping back from the waterfall way of doing things when it became clear that the new approach led to quality, user-approved solutions faster, and with less Engineering throw-away work. </p>
