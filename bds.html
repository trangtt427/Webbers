              <p>A design system is a collection of reusable components and guidelines that tells designers what, how, and when to use certain patterns when designing. Instead of reinventing the wheel each time a new feature comes along, designers can use what’s already been validated for the appropriate use cases, ensuring quality and consistency across different products. This helps designers prototype and deliver solutions faster.</p>

          <div class="container pt-3">
            <div class="line-width">
                <p class="">One of my companies started a design system as part of a huge product redesign initiative, but once multiple designers started working out of it, we soon learned that it wasn't tested for managing design at scale. A huge chunk of my time was spent finding my way around and creating custom components that the design system was supposed to supply. At the same time, I was trying to make sense of why components were built a certain way and why we settled on decisions without evaluating them for our entire ecosystem of products. Suddenly, I was inspired.

              <div class="line-width">
                  <p class=""> I was compelled to explore ideas for some of the problems that my team and I encountered. I was going to create a personal design system from scratch; one that would help designers design quickly, is easy to customize, and has clear guidelines. For a month, I dedicated a dozen hours a week towards this new design system&mdash;which I lovingly dubbed <i>Baby Design System.</i>

                  <h4 class="mb-4">Flexible Components For All Your Needs</h4>
                  <p>The design system we had fell short when it came to switching component styles. Separate components existed for their different styles and interaction states like disabled were shown in the documentation but didn't exist as a usable permutation. It was trial and error at times because of the inconsistency. Some styles were variants. Some styles were their own components. For Baby Design System, I wanted to offer more visibility into what permutations exist and be able to change them on a whim. Don't like rectangle buttons? Change them to round buttons. Want to change the primary color of your button? Change it upstream to the color of your choice and watch it proliferate for all buttons. With just a single component, users have all the controls.</p>

                  <p>My exposure to the company's design system was also a learning experience to take design documentation seriously. I was bouncing around the Figma file trying to locate guidelines and options available to me. With Baby Design System, I've organized everything in a way where users can see instantly what the different customizations are and included anchors to help users jump to master components. I took a page out of Ant Design, a popular enterprise-grade design system that does a wonderful job with their Figma file way-finding. I also used a plugin called Foundation: Color Generator to assemble some neat color palettes and documentation that show the contrast ratios for my colors.</p>

                <p>Nothing I've done here is groundbreaking; this is typically what how a design system is crafted. Getting hands on with building Baby Design System was still a rewarding experience though. Is it a comprehensive system? Not at all! There are plenty of free design systems out there that are far more mature with thousands of variants. But if you don't want to create custom components and need just the basics&mdash;buttons, forms, alerts, tabs, even tables&mdash;this design system will have you covered.

                  <p class="">Creating (and even using) a design system properly requires a lot of discipline and planning, just like building a real product for people to use. Through this endeavor, I've learned what it takes to craft components down to their pixel-perfect details, when not to create variants, and to consider accessibility frequently. And for the first time, I got to design for an interesting type of user; the designer who swears by Figma. What started off as a personal experiment is now a living, breathing, and growing passion project. I'm still adding more to Baby Design System, including handmade icons and illustrations at some point. Coming soon to Figma Community!

                  <p>I support several internal teams through service design. Many of the early initiatives were around closing business gaps of having moved away from a third-party recordkeeper. One service I helped ship was a deconversion tool to help our internal teams liquidate assets for plans that want to move to a different 401(k) provider. The benefits of having a third-party recordkeeper meant that they took care of the plan transitioning, so we never had the functionalities or the workflow for this. It was nearing the end of the year, and plans who've reached out a few times to deconvert were growing restless and impatient with our inability to take care of the deconversion.</p>

                  <p class="">I partnered with Product, Deconversion Specialists and the Director of Retirement Administration to map out the major players and actions needed for this process. We worked out things like:</p>
                  <ul><li>Standardizing the Letter of Intent (the official letter a plan gives us to let us know that they want out) and which team is responsible for getting this signed and communicated to the recordkeeping team</li>

                  <p>One of the most challenging projects was a multiyear effort in unifying all of our disparate systems into one user-friendly operations management tool. Workflows and customer information were split across different systems, each with their own set of permissions and were built without the users in mind. Internal and Support team workstreams were wildly inefficient as tickets had to be opened in order to get the right information to the right people. We were in the middle of a massive rearchitecting of our services, so we had support from Leadership to finally tackle this longstanding challenge.</p>

                  <p>As the only designer hired to work on the product, I brought some common design tools (the Sketch-InVision-Zeplin trifecta) and frameworks into the mix to improve the process between all parties. I worked with a project manager and an engineer, partnering especially close with the former to standardize regular calls with our customers. Design eventually became an important stakeholder in these meetings, which opened the floodgates for interviewing users, workshopping sessions, and clearer requirements for Engineering. The CEO started stepping back from the waterfall way of doing things when it became clear that the new approach led to quality, user-approved solutions faster, and with less Engineering throw-away work. </p>
