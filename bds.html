              <h4 class="mb-4">A Baby is Born</h4>
              <p>A design system is a collection of reusable components and guidelines that help companies create products with velocity, consistency, and quality. Instead of creating components each time they build something new, designers use what they've already established. At one company, we had a design system in place that was used to develop a product a year ago, but once multiple designers were leveraging it for different products, we learned that the system wasn't battle-tested for managing design at scale.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="container pt-3">
            <div class="line-width">
                <p class="">I was spending a lot of time hunting for components in this system and trying to make sense of what I was supposed to use. I questioned why the components were constructed and organized in a certain way and thought about I would've done differently. This compelled me to take up the challenge. I wanted to create a personal design system from scratch, one that is loaded with the essentials, clearly documented, and easy enough for people to use right off the bat. For a month, I dedicated a dozen hours a week towards this new design system&mdash;which I lovingly named Baby Design System.</p>

                  <h4 class="mb-4">Accessibility is always on the brain</h4>
                  <p>As I was starting with the basics of the design system&mdash;fonts, colors, icons&mdash;I wanted to make sure everything would have enough contrast and pose no accessibility issues. I've always had trouble coming up with color palettes (I used to not pay attention to hue, saturation, etc.), so I was happy that a Figma plugin called Foundation: Color Generator existed. I simply entered a color I wanted to use, and the plugin would generate different color profiles based on that color, including their color contrast ratios.</p>

                  <p>Instead of having multiple components for each of the permutations, I simply created a single master component, and then allowed flexibility to switch between the different types, sizes, states, icon visibility, etc. This makes it easy for designers to prototype. When searching within assets for a button, only one component will appear. </p>

                  <h4 class="mb-4">Closing the Gap in Business Operations</h4>
                  <p>I support several internal teams through service design. Many of the early initiatives were around closing business gaps of having moved away from a third-party recordkeeper. One service I helped ship was a deconversion tool to help our internal teams liquidate assets for plans that want to move to a different 401(k) provider. The benefits of having a third-party recordkeeper meant that they took care of the plan transitioning, so we never had the functionalities or the workflow for this. It was nearing the end of the year, and plans who've reached out a few times to deconvert were growing restless and impatient with our inability to take care of the deconversion.</p>

              <div class="line-width">
                  <p class="">I partnered with Product, Deconversion Specialists and the Director of Retirement Administration to map out the major players and actions needed for this process. We worked out things like:</p>
                  <ul><li>Standardizing the Letter of Intent (the official letter a plan gives us to let us know that they want out) and which team is responsible for getting this signed and communicated to the recordkeeping team</li>
                    <li>Identifying the party responsible for entering the deconversion information in our systems</li><li>Brainstorm a solution on how we liquidate assets for an entire plan</li></ul>

                  <p>One of the most challenging projects was a multiyear effort in unifying all of our disparate systems into one user-friendly operations management tool. Workflows and customer information were split across different systems, each with their own set of permissions and were built without the users in mind. Internal and Support team workstreams were wildly inefficient as tickets had to be opened in order to get the right information to the right people. We were in the middle of a massive rearchitecting of our services, so we had support from Leadership to finally tackle this longstanding challenge.</p>

                  <p>As the only designer hired to work on the product, I brought some common design tools (the Sketch-InVision-Zeplin trifecta) and frameworks into the mix to improve the process between all parties. I worked with a project manager and an engineer, partnering especially close with the former to standardize regular calls with our customers. Design eventually became an important stakeholder in these meetings, which opened the floodgates for interviewing users, workshopping sessions, and clearer requirements for Engineering. The CEO started stepping back from the waterfall way of doing things when it became clear that the new approach led to quality, user-approved solutions faster, and with less Engineering throw-away work. </p>
