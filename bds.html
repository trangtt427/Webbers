                <p class="mb-5">A company I worked for built a design system as part of a mega redesign, but as soon as multiple designers started working out of it, we learned that it wasn't as efficient when designing at scale. We ended up rebuilding some of the components as <a

                </div>




              <div class="line-width">
                  <p class=""> I wanted to try my hand at creating my own design system; one that is extensive, simple to use, and optimized for repeatability. For a month, I dedicated a dozen hours a week towards this personal project&mdash;which I lovingly dubbed <i>Baby Design System.</i>

                  <h3 class="mb-2">One Component, Many Styles</h3>
                  <p>My company's design system had too many clunky components for different states and styles of the same asset. We had two different button components for size; one small and one big. We even had components made with extra layers just so that they could be hacked for certain permutations. I aimed to be more mindful of this for Baby Design System, so I created each component to have as many customizable properties as possible. This elegantly cut down on the number of components, staying true to a clean and intentional design system.</p>

              <div class="line-width mt-5 mb-5">
                  <p class="">I applied the same principle to more complex components like tables. Properties could be changed at the table level, and at the nested row level. Each row item could be swapped between text, actions, statuses, and avatars.

                  <h3 class="mb-2">Clean Documentation</h3>
                  <p>Navigating through the company's design system was a challenge. Sometimes I'd uncover a component I was supposed to use, way after implementing what I thought was the right one. Other times I'd be using the right component, but would have to fiddle with the layers to get the style I wanted. For Baby Design System, I made it easier by documenting all possible levels of customization offered. Colors, typography, icons, components and variants&mdash;everything is organized and documented clearly so that people don't need to second guess.</p>

                <p>Nothing I've done here is groundbreaking since this is typically how a design system comes to life in Figma. Is it a comprehensive system? Depends on what <i>you</i> need. There are lots of free design systems out there that are loaded with hundreds of components and styles. But if you want to design quickly and need just the basics&mdash;buttons, forms, alerts, tabs, even tables&mdash;then this design system is for you!

                  <p class="mb-5">As satiating as this was for me, I think designers should resist the temptation to reinvent the wheel with new design systems at work. It may not be cost-efficient for a new company to go all in on their own design system as one of their first pursuits. Using one of the many popular systems out there could be a viable option depending on the business needs. What's more important than knowing how to create a design system is knowing <i>how to use one</i>. This is an ongoing project, but you can check out Baby Design System through the link below!
