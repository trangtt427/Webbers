              <h4 class="mb-4">A Baby is Born</h4>
              <p>A design system is a carefully crafted collection of reusable components and guidelines that tells designers what, how, and when to use certain patterns. Instead of reinventing the wheel each time a new feature comes along, designers can use what’s already been validated and established, ensuring quality and consistency across different products. This also saves internal teams a whole lot of time when building. At one company, we had a design system in place that was used to develop one of our products, but once multiple designers started leveraging it for their respective projects, we learned that the system wasn't battle-tested for managing design at scale.</p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="container pt-3">
            <div class="line-width">
                <p class="">I spent a lot of time hunting for components in this system and trying to make sense of what I was allowed to use. I questioned why the components were constructed and organized in the way that they were and thought about what I would have done differently. This compelled me to take up the challenge. I was going to create a personal design system from scratch; one that is loaded with the essentials, clearly documented, and easy to customize. For a month, I dedicated a dozen hours a week towards this new design system&mdash;which I lovingly named "Baby Design System".

                  <h4 class="mb-4">Flexible Components For All Your Needs</h4>
                  <p>In the design system I used at my company, there was an excess of components; separate components existed for different styles. If I wanted to use a larger button, I would need to search and see if that option was even available. This was something I wanted to correct in Baby Design System; more visibility into what permutations exist and being able to change them easily, all in one place. For every component, I've introduced multiple customizable properties. Don't like rectangle buttons? You can use round buttons! Want to change the primary color? Change it upstream to the color of your choice and watch it proliferate for all buttons! Using just a single component, you can tailor it to fit your needs, including changing the states and styles.</p>

                  <p>My experience with my company's design system inspired me to take design documentation seriously. It wasn't immediately clear to me if I was looking at a master component or one of its instances. I was bouncing around the Figma file trying to locate guidelines and what options were available to me. With Baby Design System, I've organized everything in a way where users can see right off the bat what the different customizations are. Also included are anchors to help users jump to the master components. I've had a little help along the way for documentation. I took a lot of inspiration from Ant Design, a popular enterprise-grade design system that I've used extensively in the past. I also used a plugin called Foundation: Color Generator to assemble some neat color palettes that show the contrast ratios for my colors.</p>

                <p>Is Baby Design System comprehensive? Not yet, but if you're someone who wants to get started with prototyping and needs just the basics&mdash;buttons, forms, alerts, tabs, even tables&mdash;this design system will have you covered. Building and even using a design system requires a lot of discipline and planning, no different from building a product. Through this endeavor, I've gained insights on when to create variants and got to visualize designers as my own users.</p>

                  <p>I support several internal teams through service design. Many of the early initiatives were around closing business gaps of having moved away from a third-party recordkeeper. One service I helped ship was a deconversion tool to help our internal teams liquidate assets for plans that want to move to a different 401(k) provider. The benefits of having a third-party recordkeeper meant that they took care of the plan transitioning, so we never had the functionalities or the workflow for this. It was nearing the end of the year, and plans who've reached out a few times to deconvert were growing restless and impatient with our inability to take care of the deconversion.</p>

                  <p class="">I partnered with Product, Deconversion Specialists and the Director of Retirement Administration to map out the major players and actions needed for this process. We worked out things like:</p>
                  <ul><li>Standardizing the Letter of Intent (the official letter a plan gives us to let us know that they want out) and which team is responsible for getting this signed and communicated to the recordkeeping team</li>

                  <p>One of the most challenging projects was a multiyear effort in unifying all of our disparate systems into one user-friendly operations management tool. Workflows and customer information were split across different systems, each with their own set of permissions and were built without the users in mind. Internal and Support team workstreams were wildly inefficient as tickets had to be opened in order to get the right information to the right people. We were in the middle of a massive rearchitecting of our services, so we had support from Leadership to finally tackle this longstanding challenge.</p>

                  <p>As the only designer hired to work on the product, I brought some common design tools (the Sketch-InVision-Zeplin trifecta) and frameworks into the mix to improve the process between all parties. I worked with a project manager and an engineer, partnering especially close with the former to standardize regular calls with our customers. Design eventually became an important stakeholder in these meetings, which opened the floodgates for interviewing users, workshopping sessions, and clearer requirements for Engineering. The CEO started stepping back from the waterfall way of doing things when it became clear that the new approach led to quality, user-approved solutions faster, and with less Engineering throw-away work. </p>
