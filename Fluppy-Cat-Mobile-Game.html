       <div class="twentyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">My boyfriend and I came up with a fun way to combine our passions in design, code, and cats. After spending a whole week playing different mobile games, we were inspired to make our own. We were particularly influenced by Flappy Bird and Doodle Jump because we enjoyed the simple gameplay and whimsical visuals. It was meaningful because it would be the first project that we'll work on together and would be a good test of our skills.</p>

     <h1 class="project-h1">Methods</h1>
     
       <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph">We wanted to make a game that had a lot of replay value and was easy to get into. The game was going to be a variation of Flappy Bird, a side scroller where the player has to tap on the screen repeatedly to keep the sprite hovering. The main character of the game would be an orange cat to pay tribute to my late tabby, Pibby. It was a nonsensical idea but we were going to make Pibby fly on a magic blanket, navigating between stalactites and stalagmites to collect fishbone orbs.</p>
      
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph">My boyfriend was the developer while I was the designer. Using Trello, we set up some punchlists of things we needed from each other. The look and feel of the game relied heavy on the art style and colors in which I managed. We were building it out for the iPhone so I had to follow specific iOS guidelines for different screen sizes. For every asset, I would need to create 3 versions: 1x, 2x, and 3x.</p>
      
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
      
        <ul>
            <li>Character design: I brainstormed how I wanted Pibby to look, and what art style to use.</li>
            <li>Backdrop: Because Pibby is orange, it would be a good contrast to put him in a dark environment to make him stand out. We decided on a dark purple cave theme.</li>
            <li>Obstacles: It made sense to have stalactites and stalagmites in the cave. As the player controls Pibby, they have to make sure he flies between the obstacles being generated in a horizontal scroll.</li>
            <li>Score: In order to increase the player's score, Pibby would have to collect glowing fishorbs for points.</li>
            <li>App icon: We also needed an app icon optimzed for the iOS homescreen.</li>
            <li>Logo and title screen: The last thing we needed was a logo as well as a title screen that loads up when users open the app.</li>
      
        </ul>

       <h1 class="project-h1">User Testing</h1>
      
       <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph">Using Xcode, my boyfriend developed the game using the assets we put together. We even got the sound bit of the chime whenever Pibby collects a fish orb. We installed it on both our iPhones (6 and 7S) to test it out. There was also an incredible lag during the gameplay. It turns out that the the lag was caused by the spike shapes. Triangles are difficult to generate and tend to take longer to load. I realized that it was also difficult to see the sharp points of the the tapered columns, making the game extremely hard. It was back to the drawing board to come up with a new idea. </p>
      
     <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
    
      
      
      <img src="images/fluppy-cat-mobile-game/problem.jpg" width="550px" class="project-image"><p class="caption">The spikes were hard to see and they generated a delay when playing</p>
      
     
      
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
       <p class="project-paragraph">To optimize the game, I changed the obstacles into crystals. It made just as much sense as the stalactites because crystals also form in caves. With their color and shape, it brought a nice contrast against the purple background. Thanks to their rectangular shape, there was no more lag.</p>
      
      
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
    
      <img src="images/fluppy-cat-mobile-game/crystalpillars.jpg" width="550px" class="project-image"><p class="caption">The improvement. More contrast and no lag.</p>
      
      
       <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
        <p class="project-paragraph">We further tested the game with my boyfriend's coworkers. While there were no longer any delays in generating the pillars, people found the game to be difficult still. They claimed that Pibby was too big and had difficulty moving him between the pillar openings. My boyfriend further changed the rate at which the pillars were generated, while I made Pibby smaller.</p>

     <p class="project-paragraph">This was the first iOS-specific piece that I designed. It was a fun project that allowed me to learn about designing for the iPhone. It also increased my affinity for wanting to work on more mobile entities with my boyfriend. We plan to make another whimsical game or app in the near future.</p>
