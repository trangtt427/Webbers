          <h1 class="headline mb-4"> About Me</h1>
          <h4 class="pt-4">I'm a versatile designer who's fascinated by all the ways technology fits into our lives.</h4>
          <p class="mt-4">
          I aim to unlock a better wellbeing for those who use technology, through thoughtfully designed products and services that are uncomplicated, practical, and just. Currently, I'm designing at <a href="https://squarespace.com/" class="inbodylink" target="_blank">Squarespace</a> to help people share their values with the world.
        </p>  

        <h4 class="pt-4">When it comes to creating solutions that users love, I pull out all the stops to get there.</h4>
        <p class="mt-4">
         I position design strategically; I execute at the highest level of craft and polish at every step; I collaborate with others to hone in on the best solution for the right time—all while making sure business needs are met. I've been designing for over 7 years with experience in a wide range of themes, but my sweet spot includes startups, fintech, research, and complex ecosystems.
        </p>

        <h4 class="pt-4">I'm a big fan of storytelling.</h4>
        <p class="mt-4">
          In my professional work, it's how I build engagement and empathy with stakeholders, and outside of that, it's key to how I show up in the world. Whether it's photography, design passion projects, or documenting my cooking exploits—life is a little more fun when you let others in on the elements of what makes you <i>you</i>.
        </p>
      
        <h4 class="pt-4">My binge watching abilities put my design prowess to shame.</h4>
        <p class="pt-4">
       When I haven't carved out time to do anything productive, I can easily sink a few hours watching <i>something</i>. I'm a curious person, so it doesn't take much for me to get entranced by niche YouTube content (lately, it's been aquarium building videos and I don't even own fish). If I discover an interesting show, I'll convert into a couch potato, without shame. The latest show to have its hooks in me is <a href="https://www.hbo.com/succession" class="inbodylink" target="_blank">Succession</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="pt-4">Other shows that I've recently watched, loved, and recommend:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Sex Education: Cheeky coming-of-age about a sex therapist's son and his expedition into relationships, and of course, sex. Great mesh of cast personalities, lots of funny moments, delicate handling of relatable and sensitive topics, and heartwarming messages. On Netflix.</li>
          <li>Kath & Kim: Comedic Australian sitcom about a suburban mom and daughter duo and their attitudes of modern living. On Netflix (watch the original Australian version, not the US one).</li>
          <li>Ranking of Kings: Tear-jerking anime about the struggles of a deaf prince as he sets off to prove himself to the world. On Crunchyroll.</li>
          <li>Derry Girls: Comedy about a group of Catholic school girls navigating being teenagers in conflict-ridden Northern Ireland during the 90s. On Netflix.</li>
          <li>House of the Dragon: Another high fantasy drama about clashing families and fighting for the throne, but with a better production cast than Game of Thrones. On HBO.</li>
          <li>The Last of Us (HBO): Live action adaptation of a game; a beautifully told story about two individuals doing what it takes to survive in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by parasitic fungi. On HBO.</li>
          <li>Severance (Apple TV): Mindboggling psychological thriller about a futuristic procedure that splits your work memories from your personal ones. Thought-provoking and keeps you on the edge of your seat. On Apple TV.</li></ul>
