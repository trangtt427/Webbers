                <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                  Incorta is a hyper-converged analytics app that removes the
                  ETL process in data warehousing and lets users make use of
                  their data fast. Our app allows users to bring in data to
                  create connections between tables, and ultimately, create data
                  visualizations so that businesses can make key decisions.

                  The Problem
                </p>
                <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                  The schema developers and data analysts spend hours after
                  hours looking at data and performing actions that deal with
                  tables and visualizations. One of Incorta's engaged customers
                  requested a dark theme for the UI so that their users are not
                  straining their eyes. Compared to the other roadmap items we
                  had, this feature was considered a small effort for a huge
                  return. Since it did not rely on the server team but instead,
                  close collaboration with the front-end team, it was something
                  that could be turned over quickly for the next release.

                <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                  The customers that wanted this feature are schema developers
                  and data analysts. They create SQL queries to join tables and
                  create dashboards for others to consume, respectively. Many of
                  them spend hours looking at huge amounts of data, which can
                  result in a lot of strain on their eyes. The PMs were also
                  told that some users have their OS in Dark Mode, so many of
                  their apps are dark by default. Having to switch between
                  Incorta's light app to other dark apps make it hard for users
                  to adjust their eyes. I can relate to this because when I
                  dabble in code, I prefer to do it in a dark editor like most
                  people.

                  We planned for Dark Mode to be introduced as a Lab Feature,
                  which means that admins would have to make the option
                  available to users, and that the feature is in Beta. Before
                  rolling it out to the public, we would test it out in our UX
                  Research sessions with participants. Initially, I thought that
                  creating a dark mode wasn't going to be that difficult.

                <div class="thought">
                  How hard can making a dark mode be? You just invert the whites
                  to blacks, and blacks to whites. And then work on a scale for
                  all the in between colors. Right?

                  <strong>I was absolutely wrong.</strong> I was only poking
                  around the current UI with the inspection tool to test said
                  invert changes, only to realize that there are so many styles
                  on light interfaces that don't do well in a dark mode.

                <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                  Some nuances that needed careful thinking when creating Dark

                  I spent a few hours researching best practices in Dark Mode

                  Using the Incorta Design Library, I explored variations of
                  dark colors to accommodate all the components. The most
                  effective way was to invert the colors and then modifying them
                  slightly. Our goal for Dark Mode was to make sure everything
                  is
                  <strong>consistent, accessible, and pleasant to use.</strong>
                  The high fidelity prototype was then handed to the front-end
                  team to implement in a test build, which took a week.

                  As we were testing out Dark Mode in an internal build, we came
                  across some overlooked scenarios where the proposed colors
                  were difficult to read. For example, the usual Incorta blue
                  hyperlink was hard to make out on a grey background. I was
                  unable to see these instances because I couldn't simulate them
                  in my personal environment and build. I made the design
                  changes and the engineering team updated the UI.

                  The feature was first showcased to our UX research
                  participants. As first time Incorta users, they were able to
                  carry out the tasks given to them. We used this opportunity to
                  see if there were any inconsistencies in the color paletttes,
                  but there was no negative feedback besides the fact that some
                  of our pages looked different from each other (we were still
                  migrating everything from Angular to React). The feature was
                  then rolled out to all users in the latest release as a Lab
                  Feature so that users can try it out and give feedback.

                  The customer who requested the feature was impressed with the
                  new look. Many of their users enjoyed the feature and said it
                  helped them to look at their data longer without strain on
                  their eyes. Dark Mode was rolled out to all customers as a Lab
                  Feature, and even our internal users began using it. Now that
                  Dark Mode is successful and has a decent amount of users, we
                  can now solicit feedback from a larger sample about how we can
                  improve it. We have a few pages that are being migrated to
                  React, and will eventually have to be tested.

                <p class="project-paragraph">
                  I was surprised that Incorta wanted to hop on the Dark Mode
                  train because we rarely prioritize any efforts into designing
                  things that are not directly related to complex customer
                  problems. Fortunately, we had a lot of engineering resources
                  and were able to squeeze in this request without any
                  difficulties. But this feature made our app look very "cool"
                  as many have mentioned. I wasn't sold on the whole dark UI
                  when it was introduced years ago, but now I have a better
                  understanding of situations where it can truly help our users.
