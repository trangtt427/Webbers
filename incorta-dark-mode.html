                About Incorta
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Incorta is a hyper-converged data analytics app that removes the
                ETL process in data warehousing and lets users make use of their
                data fast. Our app allows users to bring in data to create
                connections between tables, and ultimately, create data
                visualizations so that businesses can make key decisions.
              </p>

                The problem
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                The schema developers and data analysts spend hours looking at
                hundreds of rows of data. One of Incorta's most engaged users
                present their dashboards to executives in a room with dark
                walls. They claimed the white background is blinding, and said
                having a dark theme would help their analysts calibrate to
                looking at hundreds of rows of data. Compared to the other
                roadmap items we had, this feature was considered a small effort
                for a huge return. Since it did not rely on the server team but
                instead, close collaboration with the front-end team, it was
                something that could be turned over quickly for the next
                release.

                I led the UX design efforts and worked with several engineers
                for this feature. There was very little guidance from upper

                The customers that wanted this feature are schema developers and
                data analysts. They create SQL queries to join tables and create
                dashboards for others to consume, respectively. Many of them
                spend hours looking at huge amounts of data, which can result in
                a lot of strain on their eyes. The PMs were also told that some
                users already use dark mode in their other apps and having to
                switch between Incorta's app made it hard for users to adjust
                their eyes.

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                We planned for Dark Mode to be introduced as a lab feature,
                which means that feature is in beta and that admins would have
                to make the option available to their users. Before rolling it
                out to the public, we would test it out in our UX Research
                sessions with participants. Initially, I thought that creating a
                dark mode wasn't going to be that difficult.
              </p>

              <div class="thought">
                How hard can making a dark mode be? You just invert the whites
                to blacks, and blacks to whites. And then work on a scale for
                all the in between colors. Right?

                - Personal thoughts

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                <strong>Wrong.</strong> I was only poking around the current UI
                with the inspection tool to test said invert changes, only to
                realize that there are so many styles on light interfaces that
                don't do well in a dark mode.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                Some things to think about when creating Dark Mode:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Elevation doesn't work quite as well with a black background
                </li>
                <li>Contrast is harder to achieve</li>
                <li>
                  Brighter variants of current Incorta colors are needed
                </li>
                <li>Overlays can't be too dim</li>
              </ol>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                I spent a few hours researching best practices in Dark Mode and
                looked for examples of good implementation, on both desktop and
                mobile. I tried to map out every possible Incorta scenario in
                Dark Mode.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom spacetop">
                I also knew that anything style I defined now would, no doubt,
                change in the future because we were designing brand new
                features and still moving things over to React, in parallel. But
                for the time being, I had to figure out something that was
                scalable.

                Using the Incorta Design Library, I explored variations of dark
                colors to accommodate all the components. The most effective way
                was to invert the colors and then modifying them slightly. Our
                goal for Dark Mode was to make sure everything is
                <strong>consistent, accessible, and pleasant to use.</strong>
                Once I felt that the style definitions were foolproof, the high
                fidelity prototype was then handed to the front-end team to
                implement in a test build, which took a week.

                As we were testing out Dark Mode in an internal build, we came
                across some overlooked scenarios where the proposed colors were
                difficult to read. For example, the usual Incorta blue hyperlink
                was hard to make out on a grey background. I was unable to see
                these instances because I couldn't simulate them in my personal
                environment and build. I made the design changes in and the
                engineering team promptly updated the UI.

                We held a New Features Demo meeting where we presented
                internally what's coming in the next release. The engineering
                team demonstrated how to turn on Dark Mode to internal
                stakeholders, including solutions architects, pre-sales, and
                sales engineers. We received a ton of compliments from pre-sales
                and people were surprised that Incorta decided to roll this out.

              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Next up, showcased Dark Mode to our UX Lab participants. As
                first time Incorta users, they were able to carry out the tasks
                given to them. We used this opportunity to see if there were any
                inconsistencies in the color palettes, but there was no negative
                feedback besides the fact that some of our pages looked
                different from each other (we were still migrating everything
                from Angular to React). The feature was then rolled out to all
                users in the latest release as a Lab Feature so that users can
                try it out and give feedback.

                The customer who requested the feature was impressed with the
                new look. Many of their users enjoyed the feature and said it
                helped them to look at their data longer without strain on their
                eyes. Dark Mode was rolled out to all customers as a Lab
                Feature, and even our internal users began using it. Now that
                Dark Mode is successful and has a decent amount of users, we can
                now solicit feedback from a larger sample about how we can
                improve it. We have a few pages that are being migrated to
                React, and will eventually have to be tested.

                Incorta Playlist
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
                Recently, our VP of Product came up with an idea of the "Incorta
                Playlist". This new feature would allow users to set up their
                dashboard visualizations to appear in an automated
                slideshow/playlist. According to our VP, a customer requested
                this feature so that they can display important KPIs on huge
                monitors. Even though Dark Mode started off as an exploration,
                it became integrated into a roadmap item to expand into the
                upcoming Incorta Playlist.

                The takeaway: thoughts and lessons
              </p>
              <p class="project-paragraph">
                Most pre-sales and sales engineers were surprised that Incorta
                had the bandwidth to create Dark Mode because we had other
                urgent customer requests. Fortunately, we had a lot of front-end
                engineering resources and were able to squeeze in this request
                without any difficulties. I understand that there are people who
                say Dark Mode is a gimmick, but I use Dark Mode for all of my
                devices. It's nice to know that this feature is doing some good
                for our users and that it's being expanded upon.
