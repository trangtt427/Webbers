              One of Incorta's most engaged customers had a request for dark
              mode. Compared to the other roadmap items we had, this feature was
              considered a small effort for a huge return. Since it did not rely
              on the server team but close collaboration with the front-end
              team, it was something that could be turned over quickly for the
              next release as a feature bit.

              I was the only UX designer in a team of two front-end engineers
              and one PM for this feature. This role allowed me to tap into my
              visual design skills and knowledge of web accessibility.

              The customers that wanted this feature are business users, the
              ones who produce the dashboards and insights to present to the
              execs. We learned that this particular customer holds many
              sessions in their conference room, where the walls are painted a
              charcoal color. We've received feedback that anytime they present
              decks and visualizations that are white, the audience gets a
              rather rude awakening.
            </p>

              The users said it would be nice to have the option to switch to a
              dark mode, because for some schema developers, they're spending
              hours looking through hundreds of rows of data. This hit pretty
              close to home for me because when I use code editors, I prefer
              using a dark interface as well. My eyes can relate.

              The Dark Mode UI was going to be a lab feature where we test in
              our Incorta UX research sessions before rolling it out the public.
              It was planned to be enhanced further in upcoming releases as we
              created new designs for new features. Initially, I thought that
              creating a dark mode for anything was going to be easy.
            </p>

            <div class="thought">
              How hard can making a dark mode be? You just invert the whites to
              blacks, and blacks to whites. And then on work on scale for all
              the in between colors. Right?
              <div class="tenspace"></div>
              - My inner thoughts
            </div>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              <strong>Absolutely wrong.</strong> I was only poking around the
              current UI with the inspection tool to test said invert changes,
              only to realize that there are so many styles on light interfaces
              that don't do well in a dark mode.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              Some nuances that needed careful thinking when creating Dark Mode:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Elevation doesn't work quite as well with a black background
              </li>
              <li>Contrast is harder to achieve</li>
              <li>Brighter variants of current Incorta colors are needed</li>
              <li>Overlays can't be too dim</li>
            </ol>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              I spent a few hours researching best practices in dark mode and
              looked for examples of great implementation, on both desktop and
              mobile. I tried to map out every scenario in Dark Mode.

              Using the Incorta Design Library, I explored variations of dark
              colors to accommodate all the components. The most effective way
              was to invert the colors and then modifying them slightly. Our
              goal for Dark Mode was to make sure everything is consistent,
              accessible, and pleasant.

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">
              The front-end team implemented Dark Mode in a test build. As we
              were testing out the interface, we came across some overlooked
              scenarios where the proposed colors were difficult to read. For
              example, the usual Incorta blue hyperlink was hard to make out on
              a grey background. There were only a few of these types of
              instances.
            </p>

            />
            <p class="caption spacebottom">
              The grey was changed to darker shade in order to show the
              hyperlink.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacebottom">
              The Dark Mode was then updated to address the use of blues on grey
              backgrounds. The feature was made available internally first, and
              then as a feature bit in the upcoming release.

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              The customer who requested the feature was delighted with the app.
              Surprisingly, many of the internal users of Incorta enjoyed the
              feature and ended up using that mode as they said it helped their
              eyes adjust to the lists, tables, and data visualizations. Other
              customers began using the feature as well. Now that the feature is
              successful and has a decent amount of users, we can now solicit a
              lot of feedback in the next few months.
            </p>

            <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
              I was surprised that Incorta wanted to hop on the Dark Mode train
              because we rarely prioritize any efforts into designing things
              that are not directly related to complex customer problems. But
              this feature made our app look very "cool" as many have mentioned.
              I wasn't sold on the whole dark UI when it was introduced years
              ago, but now I have a better understanding of what it can do for
              our users after this project.
