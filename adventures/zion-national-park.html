      <p class="mb-5">
    Beautiful rock formations that are millions of years old, "weeping" canyons, and seasonal rivers&mdash;Zion is a red wonderland for nature enthusiasts. I don't hike often, but it's grown on me in the past few years because 1. being outside does wonders for my mental health and 2. staying mobile is really important to me. I've been putting more effort towards a health-conscious lifestyle, even buying a smart watch to monitor stats and encourage exercise. This Zion trip was a mark of new beginnings; going on adventures that test my physical limits.

      <h3 class="mb-5">A Great Shuttle System</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        My first impression of the park was "wow, this place has it all figured out". Their shuttles and regulations around personal vehicles made the park very accessible. We stayed at a lodge within walking distance to the national park, but there were free shuttles to bring tourists around. Personal vehicles aren't allowed past a certain point in the national park while these shuttles are in service, telltale signs of a thoughtful tourist infrastructure and active preservation of historic lands.

        The home of Zion National Park is Springdale, a small town outfitted with museums, outdoor gear, souvenir shops, countless inns, restaurants, and a bumbleberry pie and ice cream parlor that I regret not visiting more. No matter where you are in Springdale, the canyons appear massive in any backdrop.

          <p class="mb-6">
            Leading up to this trip, I worried whether the hikes would be too tough. I didn't have a good benchmark of hike intensities, but I've done Yosemite a few years ago which I thought was difficult. Once we arrived at the park, I appreciated the visibility into the various routes and the national park's recommendations and clear communications of trail difficulties. They had trails for all types of hikers&mdash;from casual sightseers to the daring and bold. Over a few days, we did a mixture of intense, moderate, and light hikes.

                                  For someone who's a novice, I felt that the park did a good job setting expectations and welcoming people of all levels. The trails were nicely maintained, there were tons of water refill stations, and transportation was reliable. I felt good about putting money towards keeping all of this sustainable. I ended the trip feeling re-invigorated and motivated to prioritize staying active and healthy so that I can enjoy more of this for as long as possible.
