            <h3 class="mb-5">The Farthest North I've Ever Been</h3>
            <p class="mb-6"> Our UK itinerary was action-packed with bustling tourist attractions&mdash;reservations at
              highly coveted restaurants, inter-country train rides, underground ossuaries, world-renowned museums,
              clock towers, and much more. What was I excited about the most? The quiet, sparsely populated Scottish
              Highlands. I <i>loved</i> fairies, high fantasy, and mythology as a little girl. Tack that on to my
              passion for nature, and the Highlands becomes a bucket list item. In the second week of our UK trip, we
              departed Edinburgh in the early morning to head northwest towards the Isle of Skye. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row"><img src="/assets/images/the-isle-of-skye/gateway.webp" class="img-fluid">
            <p class="figure-caption mb-6">Gateway to the Highlands: Callander.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row line-width">
            <p class="mb-6"> We stopped in Callander, a quaint little town sitting between the Lowlands and the
              Highlands, and also where our tour guide calls home. The town is referred to as the "Gateway to the
              Highlands". It's a popular pit stop with small bakeries and cafes serving tourists who journey to the
              isle. That morning was less busy than usual apparently. Not too many people and cars out, so I walked
              freely along the open roads to snap a few photos before continuing the roadtrip. </p>
          </div>

          <div class="row line-width">
            <p class="mb-6"> Within a few hours of driving, the Highland scenery started coming into view. Clouds hung
              low and there was plenty of sunlight to bring out the gold tones of the mountains, grass, rocks, and
              water. The weather in this area is known to be unpredictable and sporadic with rain at any time of the
              year, so I was glad to see some sun. </p>

          <div class="row line-width">
            <p class="mb-5"> We came to another rest break, but this time, with a bit more green and less blue skies. We
              were now in the presence of huge hills. They appeared menacing at first, but as I walked closer, it felt
              as if they were watching over and shielding me from the winds and unknowns of the other side. We enjoyed a
              few more scenic detours before making our way to Portree that evening, where we'd be spending the next two
              nights. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row line-width">
            <h3 class="mb-5">Portree: the Capital of the Isle of Skye</h3>
            <p class="mb-6"> Portree is the largest town on the Isle of Skye. It's a port town (they have amazing
              scallops) with a famous row of pastel-colored buildings (if you're familiar with San Francisco, this
              should remind you of something). The next morning, we bundled up in our thickest layers to prepare for a
              full day of drizzle, cloudy skies, and sightseeing. </p>

          </div>
          <div class="row line-width">
            <p class="mb-6"> Our first attraction of the day was the enchanted Fairy Glen, a fabled hillside known for
              its unusual geological features and supposed home of the fairies. These whimsical, grassy mounds were
              formed by a landslide. The winds were strong at the top of these hills&mdash;almost like the fairies were
              telling us to leave. </p>

            <h3 class="mb-5">The Quiraing</h3>
            <p class="mb-6"> Next up was the magnificent Quiraing, another natural wonder that resulted from a series of
              landslides. The scene was dramatic; jagged bits of land and cliffs jutting out and vanishing into the fog.
              The sun made a short appearance, creating contrast between the shadows casted by ridges and lightened
              patches of land. The earth was mushy and slippery in some parts, while other areas had better footing
              thanks to being dried out by the sun. The Quiraing was easily my favorite part of the tour. </p>

            <p class="mb-6"> People aren't the only residents of the Highlands; we saw sheep grazing in a few areas,
              totally unbothered. I kept my eyes out for some shaggy haired Highland Cattle, but no luck. </p>

          </div>
          <div class="row line-width">
            <p class="mb-6"> We made it to Neist Point where we were buffeted by harsh, cold winds walking all the way
              up to the lighthouse. The views were amazing though. Despite the treacherous winds ready to blow me off
              the cliffs at any second, it was peaceful staring into the rocky headlands. </p>

          <div class="row line-width">
            <p class="mb-6"> On the last day, we traced our route back to the Eilean Donan Castle, an iconic Scottish
              fortress that sits on an island and is connected to the mainland by a footbridge (we saw it on the first
              day but I didn't take many photos). This castle that once stood to protect its lands from vikings now
              serves as a preservation site, enlightening visitors with its history, architecture, and vantage points.
              It was also featured in a James Bond movie. </p>

              castle.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="row line-width">
            <p class="mb-6"> We made a few stops to soak in the last splendors of the Highlands. One of those was the
              Five Sisters of Kintail, a mountain ridge with five distinguished peaks overlooking a loch. Legend has it
              that these were once five human sisters who were instructed by a wizard to stand at the head of the loch
              so that they could remain attractive and admired forever. It was alluring, breathtaking, and an
              appropriate way to close out our adventure in the Highlands. </p>

            <h3 class="mb-5">A Place of Magic</h3>
            <p class=""> For 3 days, I was whisked away to what felt like a child's fantasy storybook. It's easy to
              understand why Gaelic culture is so beloved&mdash;they are endowed with lands that ooze otherworldliness,
              but have a deep respect for their history and the natural world, and a knack for storytelling. Not only
              did I get my fill of folklore, mountains, fauna and flora of Scotland, but I also got to enjoy having our
              visit thoughtfully planned out by a lovely local (who happens to be into photography as well). Big shout
              out to our tour guide, Ross from Callander! </p>
