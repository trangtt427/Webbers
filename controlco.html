              <p>Controlco integrates a building's HVAC, lighting, and energy systems into a web platform that technicians can use to keep tabs on facility productivity. The company was contracted to integrate systems for a new client's building and Leadership wanted to address the current clunky product experience in this solution. I led the redesign initiative for this project.</p>

                <h4 class="mb-4">The current experience felt "outdated" and made simple tasks harder than they needed to be</h4>
                <p>Much of the current product was designed to optimize functionality rather than ease-of-use. Clients and our internal support teams complained about the unnecessary steps in workflows, and said that it felt like they were using a software from the 90s. </p>

                <p class="">Meanwhile, software at Controlco was built through a top-down process where the requirements were funneled from the CEO to the engineers to interpret. There was lack of vision and strategy; engineers didn't have the insights to know what users needed and were constantly scrapping some of their code upon any type of feedback. All of this led to a product experience that was inconsistent throughout and riddled with frivolous interactions for users. </p>

                  <p>I collaborated with a project manager and an engineer, partnering especially close with the former to standardize regular calls with our customers. Design eventually became an important stakeholder in these meetings, which opened the floodgates for user interviews, ideation sessions, and clearer requirements for Engineering. I also had the team adopt the Sketch-Zeplin-InVision trifecta of design tools to improve the design-engineering handshake process. We eventually evolved our process to be less waterfall and more centered around users, which led to faster user-approved solutions and less Engineering throw-away work.</p>

                    <p>In these calls, I met with the primary users of the Controlco app, who go by many names&mdash;facility/field technicians/BAS technicians. While they've admitted that "tech" isn't their forte, they have a strong base of mechanical knowledge (and wit). Their daily job is to maintain an optimal environment for their malls and high-rises. They're also monitoring the energy usage of their facilities so that they can make key decisions about operating costs.</p>

                  <li>Having to swim through noisy data to locate certain system statuses and</li>

                  <p>I came up with designs that got rid of the clunky behaviors that users didn't like (dropdowns for boolean inputs, confusing filter patterns, etc.) and offered improvements in navigation (pagination, no dead links, etc.). Some key features include:</p>

                    <p>Since getting quality data quickly was a point of friction, I explored ideas for a homepage dashboard with KPIs. Previously, users were plowing through all of their HVAC and lighting panel data and relying on subtle UI elements to see if anything was off. I worked with users to organize the information and give priority to the ones that had wide system implications (chiller towers, water cooling systems, etc.).</p>

                    <p>
                      While it doesn't happen too often, a user error could cost millions of dollars to remediate. To reduce the chance of user mistakes, I introduced confirmation dialogs and visually de-emphasized risky actions on the UI, making them less front and center.</p>

                  <p>Users were kept in the loop and got to experience the prototypes to offer feedback for refinement, a process that was unfamiliar to them but sorely welcomed and appreciated. This process allowed users to somewhat onboard themselves with the new designs, quelling their earlier anxieties about relearning a new product.</p>
                    <p class="pt-3">
                    Our internal team thrived throughout this new process. With design efforts taking place upstream to understand our users better, engineers felt more confident with what they were building. We were obtaining feedback on wireframes and validating ideas more frequently with users before engineers jumped into the code. I wrote guidelines and created artifacts and libraries to make sure that whatever we were doing or making, is repeatable and reusable.</p>

Now, they get time back to work on requirements that align closely to what users actually want, and are a part of a more inclusive team structure. </p>
