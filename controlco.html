              <p>Controlco centralizes HVAC systems and networks into a white-labeled web interface that facility management teams can use to protect their data, improve comfort, and decrease their operating expenses. Leadership wanted to make software a competitive advantage, so they turned their focus on improving the user experience. The objective was to deliver a modernized application to a new client, who contracted us to service one of their buildings.</p>

                <p class="">Software at Controlco was built through a top-down process where the requirements were funneled from the CEO to the engineers to interpret. Unfortunately, there was lack of vision and strategy; engineers didn't have the insights to know what users needed and were constantly scrapping some of their code upon any type of feedback. All of this led to a product experience that was inconsistent throughout and riddled with frivolous workflows for users. </p>

                  <h2 class="mb-4">Leading with Design</h2>
                  <p>As the first dedicated product designer, I brought some common design tools (the Sketch-InVision-Zeplin trifecta) and frameworks into the mix to improve the process between all parties. I worked with a project manager and an engineer, partnering especially close with the former to standardize regular calls with our customers. Design eventually became an important stakeholder in these meetings, which opened the floodgates for interviewing users, workshopping sessions, and clearer requirements for Engineering. We eventually evolved our process to be less waterfall and more centered around users, which led to faster user-approved solutions and less Engineering throw-away work.</p>

                    <p>The primary users of the Controlco flagship software go by many names&mdash;facility/field technicians or controls/BAS technicians&mdash;and have a vast and blended knowledge of HVAC, lighting, mechanical, and systems programming.

                <p>In one of the user calls I held, we learned that the threats to their daily productivity are having to swim through noise and data to find certain system statuses, and the extraneous actions needed to schedule HVAC or lighting events. When it comes to training other staff, they said there was a steep learning curve because nothing was intuitive in the application&mdash;system chillers were once accidentally activated without a layer of user confirmation.</p>

                  <p>Since getting quality data quickly wasn't exactly a frictionless experience, I explored a homepage dashboard with the KPIs and introduced basic table workflows like filtering, searching, and pagination. Previously, users were plowing through all of their HVAC and lighting panel data and rely on subtle UI elements to see if anything was off. I worked with users to organize the information and give priority to the ones that had wide system implications (chiller towers, water cooling systems, etc.)</p>

                    <p>
                      While it doesn't happen too often, a user error could cost millions of dollars to remediate.
                      To reduce the risk of user errors, I designed confirmation dialogs and visually de-emphasized risky actions on the UI. In addition to this, there were other optimizations made in the redesign like improved navigation, recognizable patterns in workflows, and better representation of data to ensure that users are more intentional with what they were doing. Users were kept in the loop and got to experience the prototypes to offer feedback for refinement, a process that was unfamiliar to them but sorely welcomed and appreciated.</p>

                  <p>The customers weren't the only ones who benefitted with this new process; our internal team thrived too. With design efforts taking place upstream to understand our clientele, engineers felt more confident with what they were building. We were giving and obtaining feedback more frequently with the wireframes and were also validating ideas with users before engineers jumped right into the code. I wrote guidelines and created artifacts and libraries to make sure that whatever we were doing or making, is repeatable and reusable.</p>

                      <p>The client was impressed with the application and the working style we had with them. One user likened the new experience to an iPad game that his 5-year old daughter plays, calling it "modern and easy to use".

Engineers used to spend about 3 hours a week consulting with the CEO, building requirements into code, and reiterating on said code. Now, they get time back to work on requirements that align closely to what users actually want, and are a part of a more inclusive team structure. </p>
