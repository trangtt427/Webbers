              <p>Controlco integrates HVAC, lighting, and energy systems into a web interface that facility management teams can use to keep tabs on their buildings' operational performance. We were contracted to integrate systems for a new client's building and Leadership wanted to address the current clunky product experience in this solution.</p>

                <p class="">Meanwhile, software at Controlco was built through a top-down process where the requirements were funneled from the CEO to the engineers to interpret. There was lack of vision and strategy; engineers didn't have the insights to know what users needed and were constantly scrapping some of their code upon any type of feedback. All of this led to a product experience that was inconsistent throughout and riddled with frivolous interactions for users. </p>

                  <p>I collaborated with a project manager and an engineer, partnering especially close with the former to standardize regular calls with our customers. Design eventually became an important stakeholder in these meetings, which opened the floodgates for user interviews, ideation sessions, and clearer requirements for Engineering. I also had the team adopt the Sketch-Zeplin-InVision trifecta of design tools to improve the design-engineering handshake process. We eventually evolved our process to be less waterfall and more centered around users, which led to faster user-approved solutions and less Engineering throw-away work.</p>

                    <p>The primary users of the Controlco flagship software go by many names&mdash;facility/field technicians or controls/BAS technicians&mdash;and have a vast and blended knowledge of HVAC, lighting, mechanical, and systems programming.

                  <p>Since getting quality data quickly was a point of friction, I explored ideas for a homepage dashboard with KPIs. Previously, users were plowing through all of their HVAC and lighting panel data and relying on subtle UI elements to see if anything was off. I worked with users to organize the information and give priority to the ones that had wide system implications (chiller towers, water cooling systems, etc.).</p>

                    <p>
                      While it doesn't happen too often, a user error could cost millions of dollars to remediate. To reduce the chance of user mistakes, I introduced confirmation dialogs and visually de-emphasized risky actions on the UI. In addition to this, there were other optimizations made in the redesign like improved navigation and more familiar patterns that users recognized instantly. Users were kept in the loop and got to experience the prototypes to offer feedback for refinement, a process that was unfamiliar to them but sorely welcomed and appreciated.</p>

                  <p>Our internal team thrived throughout this new process. With design efforts taking place upstream to understand our users better, engineers felt more confident with what they were building. We were obtaining feedback on wireframes and validating ideas more frequently with users before engineers jumped into the code. I wrote guidelines and created artifacts and libraries to make sure that whatever we were doing or making, is repeatable and reusable.</p>

                      <p>The client was impressed with the the product experience and the working style we had with them. One user likened the new experience to an iPad game that his 5-year old daughter plays, calling it "modern and easy to use".

Engineers used to spend about 3 hours a week consulting with the CEO, building requirements into code, and reiterating on said code. Now, they get time back to work on requirements that align closely to what users actually want, and are a part of a more inclusive team structure. </p>
