              <p>Controlco centralizes HVAC systems and networks into a white-labeled web interface that facility management teams can use to protect their data, improve comfort, and decrease their operating expenses. Despite being a distributor of all things HVAC and smart buildings-related, Controlco wanted to make software a competitive advantage, which is why they decided to focus on improving the user experience. The objective was to deliver a modernized application to a new client, who contracted us to service one of their buildings.</p>

                <p class="">Controlco operated very much like its peers in the construction sector. Software was built through a top-down process where the requirements were funneled from the CEO to the engineers to interpret. Unfortunately, there was lack of vision and strategy; engineers didn't have the insights to know what users needed and were constantly scrapping some of their code upon any type of feedback. All of this led to a product experience that was inconsistent throughout and riddled with frivolous workflows for users. </p>

                  <h4 class="mb-4">Leading with Design</h4>
                  <p>As the only designer hired to work on the product, I brought some common design tools (the Sketch-InVision-Zeplin trifecta) and frameworks into the mix to improve the process between all parties. I worked with a project manager and an engineer, partnering especially close with the former to standardize regular calls with our customers. Design eventually became an important stakeholder in these meetings, which opened the floodgates for interviewing users, workshopping sessions, and clearer requirements for Engineering. The CEO started stepping back from the waterfall way of doing things when it became clear that the new approach led to quality, user-approved solutions faster, and with less Engineering throw-away work. </p>

                    <p>The primary users of the Controlco flagship software go by many names&mdash;facility/field technicians or controls/BAS technicians&mdash;and have a vast and blended knowledge of HVAC, lighting, mechanical, and systems programming. Their job is to keep facilities running in an optimal environment.</p>

                 <div class="line-width">
                <p>In one of the user workshops I held, we learned that the threats to their daily productivity are having to swim through noise and data to find certain system statuses, and the extraneous actions needed to schedule HVAC or lighting events. When it comes to training other staff, they said there was a steep learning curve because nothing was intuitive in the application&mdash;system chillers were once accidentally activated without guardrails or extra user confirmation.</p>

                  <h4 class="mb-4">Quality-of-life Improvements</h4>
                  <p>To help users get to their data quickly, I designed a homepage dashboard with the KPIs they needed and introduced basic table workflows like filtering, searching, and pagination. To reduce the risk of user errors, I designed confirmation dialogs and visually de-emphasized risky actions on the UI. In addition to this, there were other optimizations made in the redesign like improved navigation, recognizable patterns in workflows, and better representation of data. Our users were kept in the loop and got to experience the prototypes to offer feedback for refinement, a process that was unfamiliar to them but sorely welcomed and appreciated.</p>

             <div class="container pt-5">
              <div class="line-width">
                  <p>The customers weren't the only ones who benefitted with this new process; our internal team thrived too. With design efforts taking place upstream to understand our clientele, engineers felt more confident with what they were building. We were giving and obtaining feedback more frequently with the wireframes and were also validating ideas with users before engineers jumped right into the code. I wrote guidelines and created artifacts and libraries to make sure that whatever we were doing or making, is repeatable and reusable.</p>

                      <p>The client enjoyed the relationship they had with us as well as the application we created for them. One user likened the new experience to an iPad game that his 5-year old daughter plays, calling it "modern and easy to use". Initially, we were contracted just for that one property, so we were surprised and delighted to find out that they wanted us to service the other properties in their portfolio. </p>

                        <p class="">Another win for us was that we matured as a product development team. Engineers used to spend about 3 hours a week consulting with the CEO, building requirements into code, and reiterating on said code. Now, they get time back to work on requirements that align closely to what users actually want, and are a part of a more inclusive team structure. </p>
