              Since the company's inception, there had been no design thinking
              approach at Controlco. Engineers took requirements straight from
              the CEO to develop a product that lacked polish and a consistent
              user experience. In 2016, I was the first dedicated UX hire. I
              headed up a redesign initiative to bring technicians a revamped
              experience, while introducing industry-standard tools and a
              user-focused approach to product development.

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Our discoveries led us to believe that the platform lacked direction
          for users. Users felt that having a high level view of their system
          would help identify where they should be focusing their attention.
          Research revealed that users were interested in knowing:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>How many units are on/offline.</li>
          <li>What alarms were activated.</li>
          <li>Are there any statuses users should be aware of.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          In addition to wanting a sense of guidance as they work, users shared
          their feelings of dread when interacting with the app. Despite working
          in an industry where design is only an afterthought, the facility
          technicians still criticized the app for not being intuitive nor
          engaging enough to make their assignments more pleasant.

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          I picked the technicians' brains about what KPIs they wanted to see
          and how they'd be beneficial. I wanted to make sure that the dashboard
          was not convoluted with extraneous details and that we were showing
          data that would be most helpful to users. The tradeoff of including a
          lot of KPIs meant that the dashboard would lose its purpose of
          presenting key information in a quickly ingestible format.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          After our discussions, the technicians said those points were "nice to
          haves" but agreed that they didn't bring any real value to the
          dashboard. We aligned on optimizing the dashboard to prioritize only
          impactful data.

          After its launch, the new Controlco app was met with success. Users
          called the new design "refreshing" and claimed that it was more
          performant. While we garnered a lot of positive feedback from users,
          we also wanted to evaluate the impact via metrics. We tracked how long
          it took for users to complete certain duties, such as changing
          overrides on equipment, setting up event schedules, and confirming how
          many units were occupied. With the new design and dashboard
          specifically, users were unsurprisingly spending less than half the
          time they were originally spending.

          As a result of the redesign, the customer wanted to contract Controlco
          to integrate a few other facilities in their portfolio. My biggest
          personal achievement, however, was helping the company pivot towards
          better design methodologies and being user-focused. This framework and
          momentum carried into all of our subsequent projects.
