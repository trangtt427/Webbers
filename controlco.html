          Our discoveries led us to believe that users wanted a didactic
          platform. The most pressing area of friction for users was that they
          lacked the visibility of seeing an overall "health" on their system.
          Having a feature like this would give users guidance on where they
          should be focusing their attention and what to do next.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Research revealed that users were interested in knowing:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>How many units are on/offline.</li>
          <li>What alarms were activated.</li>

          In addition to wanting a sense of guidance for their in-app actions,
          users shared their feelings of dread when interacting with the app.
          Despite working in an industry where design is not prioritized, the
          facility technicians still wanted the app to be intuitive and engaging
          so that their workflow was more pleasant.

            We ventured away from our dark palette of blues and blacks, which
            were our go-to colors for our other clients, at the discretion of
            our VP of Product. We wanted to associate a brand new palette of
            lighter colors to the uplifting of our product. I played around with
            different color combinations and eventually captured a set of colors
            that were versatile and user-approved.

          After its launch, the new Controlco app garnered a lot of positive
          feedback from users and internal stakeholders alike. In order to
          quantify the impact of our efforts, we went ahead and recorded the
          time it took for users to set up schedules to compare with the times
          they initially spent with the old interface. We managed to reduce the
          time users were spending on this task.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          As a result of the redesign, one of our customers wanted to use
          Controlco as the systems integrator for a few other facilities in
          their portfolio. My biggest personal achievement, however, was helping
          the company pivot towards being design-oriented and user-centric,
          which was reflected in how we proceeded with subsequent projects.
