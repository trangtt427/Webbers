            Controlco integrates IoT systems to provide a platform for field
            technicians to manage HVAC, lighting, energy, and other data.
            However, the product was piecemealed together without design or a
            deep understanding of user behaviors and needs, resulting in a
            Frankenstein app that users griped about.

            One of our customers was integrating lighting control panels, which
            meant a new feature was to be added in product to utilize that data.

            that would finally address all the current product flaws.

          <p class="project-paragraph">
            After its launch, the new Controlco app garnered a lot of positive
            feedback from users and internal stakeholders alike. In order to
            quantify the impact of our efforts, we went ahead and recorded the
            time it took for users to set up schedules to compare with the times
            they initially spent with the old interface. We managed to reduce
            the time users were spending on this task.
          </p>
          <p class="project-paragraph">
            As a result of the redesign, one of our customers wanted to use
            Controlco as the systems integrator for a few other facilities in
            their portfolio. My biggest personal achievement, however, was
            helping the company pivot towards being design-oriented and
            user-centric, which was reflected in how we proceeded with
            subsequent projects.
