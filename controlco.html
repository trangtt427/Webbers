      <p>
      Most Controlco customers are used to the old-fashioned products and processes of the slowly changing HVAC industry, but the company was ready to make UX a competitive advantage. Modern clients, internal support teams, and prospects have already taken jabs at the product feeling and looking like a program from the 90s.

          <p>
            Projects lacked vision and strategy; engineers didn't have the insights to know what users needed and were constantly scrapping their code upon any type of feedback. There was no discovery or design. All of this led to a fragmented product experience for users, and for engineers, a frustrating way of working.

              Our main users, field technicians, joined these calls and offered feedback and detailed accounts of the work they do. Their job is to maintain a comfortable environment for malls, data centers, and high-rises. While they've admitted that tech isn't their forte, they know their way around programming IoT equipment.

                    The field technician's day-to-day rarely changes. Using the software, they're looking through tables of data to see if any of their air handler units, lighting panels, and alarms are performing outside of optimal conditions. If anything is off, they'd have to troubleshoot the device and program it manually.

                <p class="mt-4">Since getting quality data quickly was a point of friction, I explored ideas for a homepage dashboard with KPIs. Previously, users were plowing through all of their HVAC and lighting panel data and relying on subtle UI elements to flag exceptions. I worked with users to organize the information and give priority to data that could inform of potential system-wide failures, like malfunctioning water tanks and chiller towers.

                Users were kept in the loop and got to experience working with prototypes to offer feedback for refinement, a process that was unfamiliar to them but sorely welcomed and appreciated. We saw success with design efforts taking place upstream to understand our users better. We were obtaining feedback on wireframes and validating ideas more frequently with users before engineers jumped into the code.

With this strategy, we're able to work towards a more defined vision and consistently deliver a cohesive and elegant experience for users.
