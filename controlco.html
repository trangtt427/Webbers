          platform. The biggest challenge for users was that they lacked the
          visibility of seeing the "health" of their facility. Having a feature
          like this would instruct users on where they should be focusing their
          attention and what to do next.
        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Research revealed that users were interested in knowing:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>How many units are on/offline.</li>
          <li>What alarms were activated.</li>

          In addition to wanting a sense of guidance for their in-app actions,
          users shared their feelings of dread when interacting with the app.
          Despite working in an industry where design is not prioritized, the
          facility technicians still wanted the app to be intuitive and engaging
          so that their assignments could be more pleasant.

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          After its launch, the new Controlco app was met with success. We
          garnered a lot of positive feedback from users, but we also wanted to
          evaluate the impact of our efforts beyond qualitative metrics. I
          observed how long it took for users to complete certain duties, such
          as changing overrides on "dummy equipment", setting up event
          schedules, and confirming how many units were occupied. With the new
          design, users were spending less than half the time they were
          originally spending in the old UI. Users especially liked the new
          dashboard and the improvements in the HVAC page.

        </p>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          As a result of our accomplishments, this specific customer wanted to
          use the newly designed platform for a few other facilities in their
          portfolio. We ended up closing a contract to enable that. Even though
          our outward impact was large, my biggest personal achievement was
          helping the company pivot towards being user-focused. For all of our
          subsequent projects, we used the same framework and processes to
          approach our problems.
