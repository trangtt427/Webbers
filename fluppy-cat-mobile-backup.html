                Creating a Game With a Low Barrier to Entry
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph">
                We wanted to make a game that had a lot of replay value and was
                easy to get into. The game was going to be a variation of Flappy
                Bird, a side scroller where the player has to tap on the screen
                repeatedly to keep the sprite hovering. The main character of
                the game would be an orange cat as a tribute to my late tabby,
                Pibby. It was a nonsensical idea but we were going to make Pibby
                fly on a magic blanket, navigating between stalactites and
                stalagmites to collect fishbone orbs.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                Using Trello, we set up a punchlist of things we needed from
                each other. The look and feel of the game relied heavily on the
                art style and colors in which I managed. We were building it out
                for the iPhone so I had to follow specific iOS guidelines for
                different screen sizes. For every asset, I would need to create
                3 versions: 1x, 2x, and 3x.
              </p>

              <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">
                The following assets were needed:
              </p>
              <ol class="spacebottom">
                <li>
                  Character design: I brainstormed how I wanted Pibby to look
                  and what art style to use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Backdrop: Because Pibby is orange, it would be a good contrast
                  to put him in a dark environment to make him stand out. We
                  decided on a dark purple cave theme.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Obstacles: It made sense to have stalactites and stalagmites
                  in the cave. As the player controls Pibby, they have to make
                  sure he flies between the obstacles being generated in a
                  horizontal scroll.
                </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                  Score: In order to increase the player's score, Pibby would
                  have to collect glowing fishorbs for points.
                </li>
                <li>
                  App icon: We also needed an app icon optimzed for the iOS
                  homescreen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Logo and title screen: The last thing we needed was a logo as
                  well as a title screen that loads up when users open the app.
                </li>
              </ol>
