       <div class="fortyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">Controlco integrates systems for centralized building automation controls. They are a B2B company specializing in IoT  products that lets users see trending data and operate their facilities. These products are in-browser applications where users can log in to access their building's innerworkings. Controlco serves corporations that own malls, high-rises, and data centers.</p>

    <h1 class="project-h1">Project Overview</h1>
     
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
    
    <p class="project-paragraph">Data centers contain complex systems of power and energy. While we were in the midst of building out the software for a few Infomart data centers, we didn't have a feature to show the summary of powers. As my first large scale autonomous project at Controlco, I was responsible for creating this part of the product.</p>
     
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
      <p class="project-paragraph"> After the VP of Ops showed me old examples of old energy summary pages, I could easily see why they needed an upgrade badly. This dashboard would be a read-only deliverable where users will not be able to change operational settings. The goal was to create an interface that showed clients what they wanted, but without overwhelming them with too many tables of IoT data.</p>

     <h1 class="project-h1">The Challenge</h1>
    
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph">Our clients are used to seeing both real power and apparent power, kW and kVA respectively, for every point. However, they also sectioned these points into three phases, which meant there would be hundreds of points to show. The biggest challenge was coming up with a concept to show all of this data without the clutter. I felt that it wasn't a good idea to show both kW and kVA at once because it was just simply unnecessary. The engineers claimed that they needed all of these points present at first glance, but I felt that I could come up with a solution to keep it clean. </p>

        <h1 class="project-h1">Methods</h1>
      
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph">I worked closely with my VP of Ops for this project, communicating my idea about showing kW and kVA separately. While he said that the field engineers prefer seeing both units of electrical power, he trusted my instinct to try out a different concept anyway. I created a simple wireframe of a single table.</p>
      
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
      <img src="images/infomart-energy-summary-dashboard/infomartmockup.png" class="project-image"><p class="caption"> An example of what the table looks like for each unit</p>
      
        
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
       <p class="project-paragraph">The data center contains a few power units: power distribution units (PDU), uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), and distribution panels. There are several of each unit, and they also contain phases of electrical power (A,B,C). The clients wanted to see a live average as well as a total sum of all units. I met these requirements but also improved the interface from the previous energy summary pages in the following ways:</p>
      
      
      <div class="twentyspace"></div>
      
        <ul>
            <li>Each row would be a different color to make it easier to track</li>
            <li>The sum appears on the right as its own entity because it is the most important value on the page.</li>
            <li>I created a toggle to switch between kW and kVA</li>
      
        </ul>
     
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>

      <h1 class="project-h1">The Results</h1>
     
      <div class="fortyspace"></div>
      
     <p class="project-paragraph">I went on to develop the product after getting the final approval. In the end, the clients were fine using a toggle to show the units of power separately. They understood that it wasn't user-friendly to have all that data appear at once, but it was just something they were used to. I created the toggle with a smooth transition between the values so that way it wasn't disorienting for users. This feature was implemented in the rest of the Infomart data centers that we've integrated.</p>
