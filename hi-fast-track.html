  <h3 class="mb-5">After facilitating a 2.5 hours-long whiteboarding session with the CXO and Product Marketing Director, we landed on a vision of a "just click next" experience.</h3>
  <p> When designing their 401(k) plan, admins can choose options for eligibility, employer match, vesting, and length of service. However, years of industry trends and our own data suggested a few standard configurations that companies lean towards. We aimed to offer curated plans based on those conventions to limit choice paralysis. This new experience includes social proof, in-app education, and reduced industry jargon.</p>

          We only ask admins a few choices about their plan design, thanks to integrations with our payroll partner that already pull in the admin's data.
