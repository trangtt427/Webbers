  <p> When designing a 401(k) plan, an admin can customize almost anything, but years of industry trends and insights suggested a few standard configurations that companies lean towards. We aimed to offer curated plans based on those conventions to limit choice paralysis. This paradigm shift includes social proof, in-app education, and reduced jargon.</p>
