To remain in good standing with them, we had to deliver this within four months. This initiative became the company's highest priority for the first half of the year, touching systems across growth, sales, integrations, internal tooling, product, and legal.

  <p> When designing a 401(k) plan, an admin can customize almost anything, but years of industry trends and insights suggested a few standard configurations that plans tend to lean towards. We aimed to offer curated plans based on those conventions to limit choice paralysis.</p>
