            <p> After receiving customer complaints about the Human Interest setup experience, a top SMB payroll provider asked us to get to the bottom of things. This was detrimental because referrals from partner payroll providers make up a big slice of our signups.</p>

                  <p> The current setup flow threw daunting jargon at admins without clear definitions and didn't clue them in to where they're at in terms of progress. Also, admins are forced to speak to a Human Interest onboarding specialist in order to launch their 401(k).</p>

            <p class="">  This became the company's
              highest priority for the year, touching domains across growth, sales, integrations, product, and legal. My role involved (1) helping the team understand admin behaviors with secondary research and interviewing onboarding specialists, (2) carrying designs from concept to detailed, (3) scaling the design system, and (4) a bit of quality assurance.

            <p class=""> Human Interest achieved preferred partner status and hit a recordbreaking amount of signups,
