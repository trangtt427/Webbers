              <p>SMB 401(k) provider, Human Interest, was also guilty of this. Admins were put through the wringer trying to understand all the parts of designing a 401(k) plan while making choices with the little information they're given. They also couldn't make their plan live without a meeting with an implementation specialist, who then recites all of the admin's choices and tries to upsell.</p>

            <p class="">Fast Track was first released in beta to customers connected to our partner payroll
              provider and then to everyone else in September 2023. Human Interest kept its partner status and hit a recordbreaking amount of signups,
              validating that there is a market of savvy but busy admins who prefer a no-touch setup. Fast Track was so successful that in the coming years, Human Interest started building a whole team to support and evolve this new business line. Read
