  <p> When designing their 401(k) plan, admins can choose options for eligibility, employer match, vesting, and length of service. However, years of industry trends and our own data suggested a few standard configurations that companies lean towards. We aimed to offer curated plans based on those conventions to limit choice paralysis. This new experience includes social proof, in-app education, and reduced industry jargon.</p>
