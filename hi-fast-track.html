            <p class="">Almost everything about a 401(k) plan can be customized, but research insights suggested that companies lean toward a few popular configurations. In our proposal, we'd ask admins to make explicit decisions on only a few things, while deferring nonessential tasks to a later time. All the admin has to do is confirm some of the defaulted selections.</p>

            <p class="">Fast Track was first released in beta to customers connected to our partner payroll
              provider and then to everyone else in September 2023. Human Interest achieved preferred partner status and hit a recordbreaking amount of signups,
              validating that there is a market of savvy but busy admins who prefer self-serve. Fast Track was so successful that in the coming years, Human Interest started building a whole team to support and evolve this new business line. Read
