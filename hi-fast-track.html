            <p>After getting customer complaints about the Human Interest onboarding, a top SMB payroll provider responsible for referring these customers asked us to get to the bottom of the issues. If we didn't, we'd lose our partnership and in turn, the big chunk of revenue we get from these referrals.</p>

            <p class="">  This became the company's
              highest priority for the year, touching domains across growth, sales, integrations, product, and legal. My role involved (1) helping the team understand admin behaviors with secondary research and interviewing onboarding specialists, (2) carrying designs from concept to detailed, (3) scaling the design system, and (4) a bit of quality assurance.

            <p class="mb-4">Almost everything about a 401(k) plan can be customized, but research suggests that companies lean toward a few popular configurations. Our proposal is to ask admins to make explicit decisions on a few things, while deferring nonessential tasks to a later time. All the admin has to do is confirm some of the defaulted selections.</p>
