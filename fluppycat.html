    <h1 class="project-h1">A Whimsical Game for iOS</h1>



    <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">After spending a whole week downloading and playing different mobile games, I was inspired to make my own. My boyfriend and I were influenced by popular games like by Flappy Bird and Doodle Jump because of their simple gameplay and eccentric visuals. The game is intended only for iOS because my boyfriend wanted to experiment with Xcode. Also, both of us owned iPhones so it would be easier to test.</p>

        <div class="subhead">Creating the Assets</div>
     <h1 class="project-h1">The Look and Feel</h1>



     <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">The game mechanics are borrowed from Flappy Bird, a side scroller where the player has to tap on the screen repeatedly to keep the sprite from crashing into obstacles. We decided that Pibby (named after my late orange tabby) was going to be the main character. It was a nonsensical idea but we were going to make Pibby fly on a magic blanket, navigating between stalactites and stalagmites to collect fishbone orbs.</p>



      <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">As the visual and interaction designer, I had to follow specific iOS guidelines for app design. There would be 3 versions in order for the assets to scale well. I designed the following:</p>


        <ul>
            <li>Character sprite</li>
            <li>Backdrop</li>
            <li>Objects like fishbones and obstacles</li>
            <li>App icon</li>
            <li>Logo and title screen</li>

        </ul>

       <h1 class="project-h1">Trial and Error</h1>


     <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">After the creation of the assets, the game was developed using Xcode. We even got the sound bit of the chime whenever Pibby collects a fishbone. Once we installed it and gave it a test run, we soon realized that there was a huge lag during the gameplay. It turns out that the the lag was caused by the triangular-shaped obstacles. Triangles are difficult to generate therefore taking a longer time to load. In addition to the lag, I realized that it was also difficult to see the sharp points of the the tapered columns, making the game extremely hard. <strong>The solution: create rectangles instead of triangles.</strong> </p>

                    <img src="images/fluppy-cat-mobile-game/problem.jpg"><p class="caption spacebottom">The old version with the stalactites and stalagmites</p>



       <img src="images/fluppy-cat-mobile-game/crystalpillars.jpg">
             <p class="caption spacebottom">Blue crystal pillars that are easier to see</p>

      </div>



       <p class="project-paragraph">I came up with the idea to use rectangles as crystal pillars. Their blue color and shape would make them easier to see and faster to generate. We replaced the old purple obstacles and, to no one's surprise, the lag was no more.</p>



        <p class="project-paragraph spacetop">We further tested the game with people we know, including friends and co-workers around our age. It turned out that people were having difficulty moving between the pillar gaps. <strong>The problem: Pibby's head was too big.</strong> The fix was made by simply scaled down the sprite. </p>

           <h1 class="project-h1">A Game of Replayability</h1>



     <p class="project-paragraph spacetop spacebottom">This was my first successful iOS-specific game that I designed. It was a fun project that allowed me to learn about designing for the iPhone and be as creative as I want. I thought it was going to be a bit more laxed being a side project and all, but I realized that I still had to maintain a process for everything. This includes proper naming conventions and time management in order to collaborate smoothly. Even till this day, we show the game to friends and strangers who end up getting asbsorbed into it and try to beat our high scores.</p>
