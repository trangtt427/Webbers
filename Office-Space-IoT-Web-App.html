        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
        <p class="project-paragraph">Controlco integrates systems for centralized building automation controls. They are a B2B company specializing in IoT  products that lets users see trending data and operate their facilities. These products are in-browser applications where users can log in to access their building's innerworkings. Controlco serves corporations that own malls, high-rises, and data centers.</p>

        <h1 class="project-h1">Project Overview</h1>
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
        <p class="project-paragraph">One of our clients is a provider of shared workspaces for small businesses and large enterprises. They contracted us to centralize several of their buildings' controls including HVAC, lighting, and other systems. While we already had an interface in place for them, I was charged with the task to come up with a new design for the product to improve usability and promote a better look.</p>

        <h1 class="project-h1">Out With the Old</h1>
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
        <p class="project-paragraph">Before my onboarding with Controlco, there weren't any other designers. There were no established processes, no workflow, and no design-first attitudes. Many of the designs were cranked out by the CEO and engineers themselves. Here are some screenshots of the interface before I headed up the new design initiatives.</p>

          <li>There was no consistency in font and color</li>
          <li>There were a few counterintuitive features like the dropdowns that contained only 2 selections</li>
          <li>No flow of information or hierarchy</li>
        </ol>

        <h1 class="project-h1">The Process</h1>
        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          The users of our products are mainly technicians and field engineers who've worked in the industry for decades. They love their data, numbers and large font, and were not very open to new designs. In order for Controlco to thrive and gain more contracts, we needed to update our products and make sure they look just as good as they perform.
        </p>
        <div class="twentyspace"></div>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          The layout for the in-browser apps are almost the same for all customers. Each website has a global navigation bar with links for a homepage, HVAC, lighting, alarms, and personnel. However, style of these apps vary between customers. The VP of Ops specifically wanted a UI that was "clean" and different from our previous dark blue themes. I created a wireframe of the product.

        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          Once a user logs in, they will land on the homepage which is a quick visual summary of each of system: HVAC, lighting, alarms, and central plant. Certain notifications will appear here, such as equipment out of their setpoint parameters or lighting panels that aren't working.
        </p>
        <div class="twentyspace"></div>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          My team and I were constantly communicating with the team of data modelers throughout the entire process. It was a highly iterative process, building up the UI and changing it up whenever there were new developments. Once everyone agreed with the barebones structure and flow, I began working on the aesthetics.

        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
        <p class="project-paragraph">On the bright side, it's always a fun and challenging process to come up with a design for a company that doesn't have a consistent brand guideline. This project gave me a lot of creative freedom, but also a lot of limitations.</p>

        <div class="fortyspace"></div>
        <p class="project-paragraph">After presenting the design to the UI and data modeling team, I received positive feedback. People warmly welcomed the new look and the simplicity of the flow. Everyone claimed that it was easy to follow and was a big step up from what they were using. Through InVision and Zeplin, I was able to communicate the style specifications to the developer.</p>

        <p class="project-paragraph">
          This project represented a milestone in my Controlco career because I was given the opportunity to introduce my own design process as well as industry-standard tools to the company. It was a push in the right direction, initiating a new mentality for the team to focus on design.
